U.S. foreign policy? International relations, national security, and defense/public policy? Then the Alexander Hamilton Society is the organization for you!
The Alexander Hamilton Society (AHS) is an independent, non-partisan, membership organization dedicated to promoting the basic principles and contemporary issues in foreign, economic, and national security policy. We are part of a national network of outstanding students, faculty, and professionals that sponsor events at many major universities. We also provide other opportunities for our members to flourish professionally and personally, and our members span worldwide and are united at basic convictions discussing the United State's role in the world. Our activities include: 
Hamiltonian Statecraft: Every student who applies to be an author will have an opportunity to get published on an issue in international relations and national security on a semesterly basis. Under the guidance of our Editor in Chief, members would receive close mentorship and active feedback on five possible entry formats: research paper, academic essay, Op-Ed, policy proposal, and book review. Additionally, students would have the opportunity to crosslist the publication with the national organization’s journal, The Hamiltonian.
Hamiltonian Diplomacy: Selected AHS members will compete in bisemesterly conferences per year for any of the following: Model UN, Model NATO, Model European Union, and Model Arab League. The delegation team would be led by the Director of Academic Programs, who would assist and coach delegates in successfully representing our Chapter to the national conference.
Speaker events and panels: The speaker panels/events provide students an understanding of what American leadership has achieved. They address complex global issues from multiple perspectives with a goal to promote critical thinking. Speakers include former Secretaries of State, Secretaries of Defense, Directors of CIA, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Senior Fellows at esteemed think tanks and civil societies in Washington D.C.
National Programming: The national charter runs intensive programs for students to educate skills and knowledge for foreign affairs and national security careers. Members of the AHS would have the opportunity to engage with scholars in foreign policy and national security through expert panels, chapter training, professional development, and networking opportunities. These include the National Defense Fellowship run by the AHS and the Ronald Reagan Institute, the Hamilton National Fellowship that provides grants for summer internships in Washington, DC, and book series that provide a wide perspective to foreign affairs, defense, and economic policy. 
Wargaming and policy simulations: The wargames and policy simulations, designed by RAND Corporation, would serve to educate our membership on American grand strategy, defense policy, and budgeting forward engagement. Led by the Director of Policy, wargames and policy simulations would be run on a monthly basis on various formats and various international crisis scenarios to provide a firsthand experience in managing and executing U.S. foreign and defense policy abroad.
Additionally, AHS stands for basic principles in U.S. foreign policy that include: 
A conviction, rooted in the history of the last century, that the world is a better, safer, and more prosperous place when the United States is willing and able to lead. And a commitment to maintaining the moral authority and material strength on which that leadership rests.
An appreciation that the world remains a dangerous place in which our power must be exercised with prudence, and where the primary threats to our security come from states that deny freedom to their own people and from non-state actors who embrace hatred and violence.
A clear recognition that, in such a world, our true friends and reliable partners are other democratic nations with whom we share an enduring commonality of values, and not simply a temporary convergence of interests.

Founded in January 2018, ARI is the University's most prominent XR club and has received recognition and generous support from other University of Michigan organizations.
Our most recent project was creating a wellness app that generates daily and weekly tasks that can be completed to nurture a collection of AR plants. This coming year we have an exciting collaboration with Visit Detroit to create an educational AR app for many of Detroit's landmarks.

Students develop individual responses to these complex issues and others while working closely with distinguished faculty and prominent visitors.

Summary: 
BLUElab is an organization currently made up of 4 project teams to foster a collaborative environment and support each other as each undergoes the socially-engaged design process. Each team works with stakeholders to address identified needs in their respective local or international community. We encourage students to seek out opportunities to hone their inter and intrapersonal skills, engage in social responsibility, participate in an interactive design experience, and develop as servant leaders. 
  Mission:
The mission of BLUElab is to build a network of project teams to effectively share knowledge and resources between teams to undergo the socially-engaged design process to implement socially, economically, and environmentally sustainable technology.
  Vision :
We hope to see BLUElab teams reflect our values throughout their projects utilizing a strong, supportive community. We will strive to be a leader on campus, preparing students to practice socially-engaged design and think through every aspect of an issue. We will develop conscious leaders who impact industry, government, and academia through their commitment to social responsibility and sustainability.
Values: Adapt, Engage, Include, Reflect, Grow, Be Thorough
The Socially Engaged Design Process:
The socially engaged design process requires project teams to take into account social, cultural, economic, and environmental contexts of their designs and implement this during their projects. This starts with a needs assessment to fully understand a community’s needs. It also involves working with the community at every stage of the design process, to create a self-sustaining project that can last without team presence. As an organization, we place heavy emphasis on building a strong partnership.

U.S. foreign policy? International relations, national security, and defense/public policy? Then the Alexander Hamilton Society is the organization for you!
The Alexander Hamilton Society (AHS) is an independent, non-partisan, membership organization dedicated to promoting the basic principles and contemporary issues in foreign, economic, and national security policy. We are part of a national network of outstanding students, faculty, and professionals that sponsor events at many major universities. We also provide other opportunities for our members to flourish professionally and personally, and our members span worldwide and are united at basic convictions discussing the United State's role in the world. Our activities include: 
Hamiltonian Statecraft: Every student who applies to be an author will have an opportunity to get published on an issue in international relations and national security on a semesterly basis. Under the guidance of our Editor in Chief, members would receive close mentorship and active feedback on five possible entry formats: research paper, academic essay, Op-Ed, policy proposal, and book review. Additionally, students would have the opportunity to crosslist the publication with the national organization’s journal, The Hamiltonian.
Hamiltonian Diplomacy: Selected AHS members will compete in bisemesterly conferences per year for any of the following: Model UN, Model NATO, Model European Union, and Model Arab League. The delegation team would be led by the Director of Academic Programs, who would assist and coach delegates in successfully representing our Chapter to the national conference.
Speaker events and panels: The speaker panels/events provide students an understanding of what American leadership has achieved. They address complex global issues from multiple perspectives with a goal to promote critical thinking. Speakers include former Secretaries of State, Secretaries of Defense, Directors of CIA, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Senior Fellows at esteemed think tanks and civil societies in Washington D.C.
National Programming: The national charter runs intensive programs for students to educate skills and knowledge for foreign affairs and national security careers. Members of the AHS would have the opportunity to engage with scholars in foreign policy and national security through expert panels, chapter training, professional development, and networking opportunities. These include the National Defense Fellowship run by the AHS and the Ronald Reagan Institute, the Hamilton National Fellowship that provides grants for summer internships in Washington, DC, and book series that provide a wide perspective to foreign affairs, defense, and economic policy. 
Wargaming and policy simulations: The wargames and policy simulations, designed by RAND Corporation, would serve to educate our membership on American grand strategy, defense policy, and budgeting forward engagement. Led by the Director of Policy, wargames and policy simulations would be run on a monthly basis on various formats and various international crisis scenarios to provide a firsthand experience in managing and executing U.S. foreign and defense policy abroad.
Additionally, AHS stands for basic principles in U.S. foreign policy that include: 
A conviction, rooted in the history of the last century, that the world is a better, safer, and more prosperous place when the United States is willing and able to lead. And a commitment to maintaining the moral authority and material strength on which that leadership rests.
An appreciation that the world remains a dangerous place in which our power must be exercised with prudence, and where the primary threats to our security come from states that deny freedom to their own people and from non-state actors who embrace hatred and violence.
A clear recognition that, in such a world, our true friends and reliable partners are other democratic nations with whom we share an enduring commonality of values, and not simply a temporary convergence of interests.

The program is based in a gymnastics gym, where volunteers and kids interact through a one-to-one ratio within the larger group. The classes consist of a stretching exercise at the beginning that is lead by the head of the program, completing an obstacle course that aims to help the kids develop new skills such as jumping, balancing, and following directions, and the classes finish with free time where the kids get to choose what they want to do, such as playing in the foam pit or on the trampolines! 
There are two sessions, both running for an hour on Sundays mornings from 10:00-11:00 and 11:15-12:15. Emails are sent out every week for volunteers to sign up on a first-come, first-serve basis and a carpool will be organized to transport volunteers to the gym. Since the gym is approximately 40 minutes away from Ann Arbor, the total time commitment is from 9 a.m. to 1:00 p.m on Sundays. Volunteers are asked to stay for both classes unless otherwise specified. No previous gymnastics skills are necessary; just a smile and lots of excitement to hang out with these awesome kiddos!

This initiative was brought about by students and advisors at the University of Michigan who collectively see a great opportunity in the Africa tech ecosystem and resolved to build a coalition to fill the gap. Thus a partnership of students, UM institutes and outside stakeholders is born.

There are two sessions, both running for an hour on Sundays mornings from 10:00-11:00 and 11:15-12:15. Emails are sent out every week for volunteers to sign up on a first-come, first-serve basis and a carpool will be organized to transport volunteers to the gym. Since the gym is approximately 40 minutes away from Ann Arbor, the total time commitment is from 9 a.m. to 1:00 p.m on Sundays. Volunteers are asked to stay for both classes unless otherwise specified. No previous gymnastics skills are necessary; just a smile and lots of excitement to hang out with these awesome kiddos!

Welcome to the Theta Chapter of Alpha Chi Omega at the University of Michigan. With an active focus in social, philanthropic, and sisterhood activities, the young women of Alpha Chi strive to make an impact in our community and the Michigan campus as a whole.
Each one of our young women is unique. With members from the east to the west coast, and even overseas, our various backgrounds help to enrich the experiences of every Alpha Chi. From an academic standpoint, diversity continues to shape our house with members pursuing degrees in Literature, Science, and the Arts, Engineering, Art and Design, Nursing, Business, and much more. Members of the Theta Chapter not only uphold their academic integrity, but they also strive to uphold the other principles of an Alpha Chi as well such as personal development and their leadership abilities. Our young women are active in over 80 organizations on campus ranging from A Cappella groups to club sports and many hold prominent leadership positions throughout campus.
Although each member is different and we are a diverse chapter, the presence of Alpha Chi Omega and the sisterhood that it offers shape our college experiences in a similar way. Activities such as painting “the rock,” all chapter lunches, as well as picnics in the Arb, and philanthropy events help bring together the different pledge classes of the Theta Chapter.
Giving back to the Ann Arbor community is one of the most rewarding aspects of being an Alpha Chi at Michigan. Because the Women’s Center of Southeastern Michigan is located right here in Ann Arbor, we are lucky enough to have members volunteer their time weekly to help women and children in need. It is in this way that our members are fortunate enough to personally see their hard philanthropic work be put to use. We take pride in philanthropic endeavors throughout the year and encourage our members to pursue community service regularly. We regularly participate in other sororities’ and fraternities’ philanthropies as well as in the University-wide Greek Week to support various philanthropic organizations in the area.
The Theta Chapter of Alpha Chi Omega truly is “The Michigan Difference.”  To all of the alumnae, please feel free to contact me at axoumichpresident@gmail.com for any information about our chapter! We would love to hear your success stories and about how the bonds that we will create today extend beyond these four years at Michigan.
Best wishes,
Chapter President

Built on the aims of manly deeds, scholarship, and love for all mankind.
Fraternity Motto: ""First of All, Servants of All, We Shall Transcend All""
Since its inception in 1909 at the 5th Chapter of Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Inc., Epsilon has continued to carry on the great traditions of Epsilon's 103 years of success and the legacy that is Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Inc. On Friday, April 10, 2009, the Epsilon Chapter of Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Inc. reached its 100th year in existence. This milestone was not only an accomplishment for the chapter, but for the entire University of Michigan community, the city of Ann Arbor, and the Michigan District and Midwestern Region of Alpha of Alpha.

Ever clinging to the motto “Nothing Questionable is Accepted,” we at Epsilon chapter
continue the tradition of excelling scholastically, athletically, and socially. A testament to this truth, Epsilon Chapter boasts 10+ Phi Beta Kappa Members, 10+ Athletic All-Americans as recently as 2000, and a steady stream of honors, awards, and accolades for service. We strive through comradeship to attain the noble goal of a balance between social and academic life and have proven wrong those who declare that both of these phase of existence are incompatible and mutually inhibitory.

We understand and recognize that past is prologue to the future and that an intimate familiarity with and reverence for what has gone on before is both central and essential to our ongoing development and survival. Brotherhood, scholarship, leadership, and service, the four principles upon which the Jewels founded Alpha Phi Alpha, continue to be the guiding values of Epsilon. It can be said that fraternity life in Alpha Phi Alpha has shown us that the ideals to which we aspire are worth striving for and that Epsilon chapter continues to be a ‘rendezvous for fraters, a sanctuary for scholars, and a haven for gentlemen.’

We offer classes in Bachata, Cuban Salsa (also known as Casino), Salsa On 2 (also known as Mambo or NY style) and dance techniques in all the styles in styling and movement.

Instructors are members of the Ann Arbor community who have experience both dancing and teaching these styles. Check out our Instagram for examples of our classes!
The class duration is 3 hours and separated in the following sections for Salsa, Bachata and Cuban Salsa: 
1) Beginner (1hr) for those who have never taken this class before, are very new to the style, or are just working on their fundamentals.
2) Social dancing (1hr) where you can just dance with other members or just talk and get to know the community! All levels are welcome!
3) Intermediate (1hr) meant for those who have more experience in the style. You can ask us for details on what this means for each style!

In our technique class we review the technique and movement in all the styles that you have seen over the month and we also have a chance to teach you a special wildcard style that changes every month! The last hour is still social dancing. 
Additionally to our classes, we also offer a dance social once a month on a Friday (typically the third Friday) from 10pm - 2am. No partner necessary!
