It is a competitive atmosphere, with weekly practices and an expectation of commitment from it's members. The team itself ranges from 10-20 participants, and will put in place a series of offense and defensive sets to be used in games. Practices will utilize a mixture of drills, conditioning, and scrimmages to help the players improve both as individuals and as a team. Tryouts will be held near the start of the fall semester in order to determine the roster, which will be split into two groups. The competitive team will be comprised of 10-12 players and will be the active participants in the games against other colleges. The remainder of the members will be part of the regular team, and will attend practices, scrimmages, and other Club basketball events. Club basketball is an outlet for students to improve their basketball skills, meet new people, stay in shape, and most importantly have fun playing the game they love.
