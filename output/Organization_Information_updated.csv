The objectives of TAMSCAMS are to provide educational and social meetings for all students of Texas A&M University who are interested in meteorology in any of its phases or applications, to provide a forum for discussions of meteorology or other related topics of general interest, and to develop and disseminate knowledge of the atmospheric and related oceanic and hydrologic sciences and the advancement of their applications at the college level. The organization strives to promote the ideals of Texas A&M University and acquaint the student body and the public with the science and applications of meteorology.
Generally held the first Tuesday of each month, TAMSCAMS meetings feature guest speakers from the meteorology and atmospheric sciences fields, weather discussions, plus announcements about upcoming events and job opportunities. Other activities throughout the school year include field trips to television stations and weather facilities, social events, and community service projects such as Big Event and Aggie Replant.
Membership is open to any student of Texas A&M with an interest in meteorology. The only requirement for membership is the payment of dues. Members must have paid dues for the current semester in order to participate in field trips or other activities requiring funding.
Two branches of the TAMSCAMS organization provide valuable experience and learning opportunities. Members of TASC, the Texas Aggie Storm Chasers, learn first hand how severe weather acts and enjoy the awesome and diverse displays of significant weather events. Chasers make every effort to report severe weather to the National Weather Service. Members must attend a mandatory safety seminar before being eligible to participate in a chase. For more information, visit the TASC website: https://www.facebook.com/texasaggiestormchasers/?fref=ts
Those interested in broadcasting should look into Texas A&M Weather Broadcasting. This branch of TAMSCAMS provides students from freshman to seniors with essential forecasting and actual on-air experience for landing an internship or job. Students volunteer as forecasters for 90.9 FM KAMU and 90.5 KTRL FM. Members also maintain our social media accounts on Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/tamuweather/), Twitter (https://twitter.com/tamuweather), and Instagram (https://www.instagram.com/tamuweather/).

American Constitution Society",https://maroonlink.tamu.edu/organization/acs,,"The American Constitution Society for Law and Policy is a group of students concerned about the pervasive conservative orthodoxy in American law and politics. We believe deeply in the importance of law as the mechanism that governs the relationships between and among the individuals and institutions that form our society, and we recognize the direct relationship between legal theory and the broader political debate about the kind of society in which we live.
In recent years, the view has been ascendant that the traditional values of compassion and respect for human dignity have little or no place in legal discourse. This view permeates all aspects of legal debate: academic scholarship, judicial interpretation, and debate about laws proposed for enactment. The cornerstone of this legal view is an approach to understanding the United States Constitution that is essentially devoid of concern for the way in which the law affects the lives of the people who make up the nation in which we live.
We believe, contrary to this conservative orthodoxy, that the law, and, in particular, the Constitution, serves human values. We believe that the Constitution is a charter of liberty, the blueprint for a noble and unique experiment designed to prevent the excesses of government in order to protect the human dignity necessary for individuals to realize the full potential of their lives. The goal of the Constitution, and the United States it created, is to permit people to succeed in the ""pursuit of happiness,"" one of the inalienable rights this nation explicitly was founded to secure to the American people.
We believe that the Constitution, and by extension, many other areas of American law, can be understood only by reference to principles of decency, reason, humanity and compassion. We believe that those who enforce the law must have concern for the way in which it affects the lives of the people who make up the nation in which we live. And we believe these principles should form a starting point for enactment, as well as interpretation, of the law.

FLARE (Freshmen in Liberal Arts Reaching Excellence) was founded in 2008 as a FLO (Freshmen Leadership Organization) to provide freshmen Liberal Arts majors the opportunity to develop both academically and socially within the Texas A&M College of Liberal Arts. FLARE provides freshmen with the tools and resources to become stronger leaders, both on campus and within the Bryan-College Station community.
  Our Purpose:
FLARE aims to create a welcoming environment for freshmen to gain exposure to the College of Liberal Arts, promote unity among liberal arts majors, create unique educational experiences outside of the classroom, promote and support diversity throughout the student body, coordinate events for liberal arts students, and to represent the College of Liberal Arts through community service projects.

How FLARE Works:

FLARE is composed of 3 junior directors, 11-14 sophomore counselors and 50-60 freshmen members. All staff members have been a part of FLARE previously. Our size enables us to create a dynamic environment for freshmen to make a big impact within the Texas A&M community and foster strong friendships within the organization. 

General meetings are held at 7:00pm every Tuesday night. During this time FLARE comes together to develop as a group. This is usually accomplished by inviting guest speakers who have valuable lessons to offer to our enrichment. Past speakers have included the Dean of Liberal Arts, James Olson from the Bush School, and many professors from the College of Liberal Arts. We also use this time to allow committees to update the organization on their projects and to keep FLARE connected as a whole.
  Committees: 
Freshmen are placed into one of five committees, each headed by two chairs/counselors. This allows for each member to work on projects that are specific to their interests. 
  The Public Relations (PR) committee deals with maintaining FLARE’s image on various social
media platforms, designing, ordering, collecting funds, and maintaining communication with
manufacturers of FLARE apparel. PR is also responsible for co-planning and co-organizing the
Spring Semester all-FLO event.

The Internal Relations (IR) committee works to keep all FLARE members connected by
planning and putting on our socials! We also work to build and strengthen friendships between
Flarians by working with the buddy system and ensuring that everyone feels included. We also
collaborate with the directors for Fall and Spring Retreats to showcase our members at the end
of each semester.
  The Programs and Special Activities (PSA) committee deals with planning and overseeing important events for
FLARE, including Parents Night and the Winter Formal. They are also in charge of planning road trips and other large group FLARE bonding activities.
  The Finance (FINE) committee attends to all matters involving raising money for the FLO throughout the year by various means, including organizing profit shares with local restaurants.

The Community Outreach (COMOUT) committee is (as the name implies) the
service committee. We coordinate volunteering opportunities for our FLARE members and help
our organization improve the university and Bryan/College Station area. 

The Cultural Inclusion and Academics (CIA) committee is in charge of providing
academic support and cultural exploration for liberal arts students within FLARE. We help
students excel in the classroom and the university by bringing faculty, organizations, and other
inspirational speakers to discuss opportunities a Liberal Arts degree has. Along with hosting
study hours throughout the week, we plan day trips for the purpose of cultural enrichment,
including outings to traditional Aggie events.
  Social Activities:
For the social aspect of FLARE, each member is placed into a family. Families are led by two counselors and are small groups that enable freshmen to meet others in FLARE outside of their committee. These groups hang out together and do various activities and competitions throughout the semester that enable growth and fun. 
Tons of extra activities are offered throughout the year to give Flarians a chance to relax and have fun together. Many socials are put on as well as a Fall and Spring Retreat and a Winter Formal. Groups often go together to movie nights and RenFest or host Girls and Guys nights. We also participate in FLO-Bowl (All-FLO powderpuff football) and FLO Cup (All-FLO soccer tournament) and are always open to more activities!

The Aggie Wranglers are the premier Country-Western dance team in the world. As a University-Sponsored level organization here at Texas A&M, our mission is to spread our love for Texas A&M through teaching and performing our distinctive style of Country-Western dance. An Aggie Tradition since 1984, we are one of the most recognizable student-run organizations on campus. If you didn’t get a chance to see us at Fish Camp or MSC Open House, then please visit our to see more of what we do.
We perform anywhere and everywhere, absolutely for free. The Aggie Wranglers travel all over the great state of Texas, and often find cool opportunities to travel out of state (and internationally) to represent A&M in performances. A few places that organization has been to are Germany, Japan, Qatar, Disney World, California, and New York.
In addition to performing, we teach both private and public dance lessons to other students and the community. Dance lessons are held in four week sessions twice/semester, and once in the summer. In those lessons we teach (almost) everything that you see us perform, and there are both beginner and advanced lessons!
If you have a heart for A&M, teaching, and performing then this organization might be for you! If you are interested in joining then take our lessons, learn how to dance our style, and come talk to us! Tryouts are typically held at the end of April, and you can find out more information about tryouts on our website.
Please follow us on Facebook and Instagram! We will be posting about lessons and special events at the Bootstack, our off-campus facility.

  Submitting a DSA Experience for High Impact Experience Designation
As part of Texas A&M University’s Quality Enhancement Plan, Aggies Commit to Learning for a Lifetime, the Division of Student Affairs is dedicated to providing educationally challenging opportunities and assessing the accompanying student learning.   One of the first steps in this process is identifying those experiences in the Division that currently meet the criteria, identified by Kuh (2010), for being considered a high-impact practice (HIP).  Not every program, activity, or student organization leadership experience needs to be a high impact experience although student learning should be the basis for all.
Division staff are encouraged to submit programs and experiences that could be considered High Impact Experiences. Please complete the form, even if you think you may not fulfill all of the criteria. We will provide you resources and support to move forward. 
The following are examples of approved High Impact Experience proposals in the Division:
Corps of Cadets International Excursions
Outdoor Leader Training
MSC Abbot Executive Experience
Student Activities Big Event Executive Experience
   High Impact Experience Criteria
Click here to review the rubric used to evaluate DSA Hips.
A Division of Student Affairs program, activity or student leadership of student organizations may be considered a high impact experience* if most of the following are met**:
Students invest time and effort to purposeful tasks.
Engagement nurtures student investment in the activity and learning from it
Students interact with staff, advisors and peers about substantive matters usually over extended periods of time.
Students experience diversity through contact with people who are different from themselves
Engagement challenges student to develop new ways of thinking about and responding to new circumstances.
Students get frequent feedback about their performance – almost continuously – in settings that allow them to respond to that feedback.
Students have the opportunity to integrate, synthesize and apply knowledge gained from their classroom/discipline to their co-curricular experience and vice versa.
Engagement in co-curricular activities provides the opportunity to discover the relevance of learning through “real-world” application and practice.
Student engagement encourages students to become aware of their values and beliefs and thus to better understand themselves in relation to others and the larger world.
 * Brownell, J. E., & Swaner, L.E. (2010). Five high-impact practices. Washington DC: Association of American Colleges and Universities.
**A case may be made for an activity that does not meet all of the criteria due to special circumstances.
  General principles/guidelines supporting the process in the Division of Student Affairs
The Division has high expectations of the students who participate in high impact experiences whether they are in leadership positions in student organizations or participants in special activities or programs.
Students will expect to learn during their time in these experiences and to be held accountable for their own learning.
HIPs in the Division of Student Affairs tie their purpose and learning outcomes to one or more of Texas A&M’s student learning outcomes for undergraduate and/or graduate students and to one the QEP learning outcomes of integrative and/or learning for a lifetime.
Assessment of student learning outcomes, program and process outcomes are assured with quality assessment plans.  Emphasis is placed on assessment methods that include the following:
A baseline marker from which to evaluate improvement and change.
Well-articulated student learning and program outcomes.
Methods to assess.
Track participants (how diverse in gender, first generation, ethnicity and other demographics, as appropriate?)
How well have students learned the outcomes established?
How well have the program outcomes been achieved?
What is the persistence rate and GPA of students in these programs compared to the University’s norms?
A reflection activity (ies) to nurture integrative and lifelong learning
Use results to make improvements and change.
Report out assessment results and results from improvement/change.

We will have representatives from non-profits come in and discuss with us what their organization does, how it was started, and give us a need that we can fundraise for. By fundraising for these sound organizations, it will not only help their organization, but it will also give our members hands-on fundraising experience (which is something that every non-profit will need to know how to do) and teach them how to explain a cause to the public. Besides speakers, we will also have ""brainstorming"" meetings, where we discuss with one another what our individual passions are, where those passions come from, common mistakes done by non-profits, the mind set behind effective non-profit organizations, and tools that the students can be utilizing while they are in college to take the first steps towards their future organization.

The American Constitution Society (ACS) believes that law should be a force to improve the lives of all people. ACS works for positive change by shaping debate on vitally important legal and constitutional issues through development and promotion of high-impact ideas to opinion leaders and the media; by building networks of lawyers, law students, judges and policymakers dedicated to those ideas; and by countering the activist conservative legal movement that has sought to erode our enduring constitutional values. By bringing together powerful, relevant ideas and passionate, talented people, ACS makes a difference in the constitutional, legal and public policy debates that shape our democracy.
Shaping Debate. The American Constitution Society brings together many of the country’s best legal minds to articulate a progressive vision of our Constitution and laws. Through its public programs (over 1,100 debates, conferences and press briefings across America each year), publications, and active on-line presence, ACS generates “intellectual capital” for ready use by progressive allies and shapes debates on key legal and public policy issues.
The American Constitution Society is also debunking conservative buzzwords such as “originalism” and “strict construction” that use neutral-sounding language but all too often lead to conservative policy outcomes. Using both traditional and new media to communicate with policymakers, judges, lawyers and the public at large, ACS presents a compelling vision of core constitutional values such as genuine equality, liberty, justice and the rule of law.
Building Networks. One of the American Constitution Society’s principal missions is nurturing the next generation of progressive lawyers, judges, policy experts, legislators and academics.
The engine that drives the organization’s work is its rapidly growing nationwide network: nearly 200 student chapters in law schools in 47 states, 34 lawyer chapters in large and small cities in every part of the country, and over 16,000 paying members and thousands of other supporters. ACS chapters offer platforms for debate and discussion about both enduring principles and the issues of the day, as well as provide opportunities for networking, mentoring and organizing around matters of both local and national significance.
Making a Difference. The strength of ACS’s ideas and the scope of its nationwide network enable it to make a difference in legal and public policy debates and ensure that law is a force to improve the lives of all people. Recent examples of ACS initiatives and programs having an impact include an Issue Brief on the constitutionality of the individual mandate in the health care reform legislation, cited during the Senate floor debate and entered into the Congressional Record; Senator Al Franken’s 2010 ACS National Convention speech in which he stated that “Originalism isn’t a pillar of our constitutional history; it’s a talking point;” and a concerted effort by ACS members to promote up-or-down votes on judicial nominations by engaging key decision makers.

It was established by a group of individuals who recognized the need to unify the professional activities within the diverse fields of nuclear science and technology.  December 11, 1954, marks the Society’s historic beginning at the National Academy of Sciences in Washington, D.C.  ANS has since developed a multifarious membership composed of approximately 10,500 engineers, scientists, administrators, and educators representing 1,600 plus corporations, educational institutions, and government agencies.  It is governed by three officers and a board of directors elected by the membership.
We, The Student Chapter
The American Nuclear Society (ANS) Student Branch at University of California Berkeley is a subsidiary of the National ANS. The main objectives of the ANS Student Branch is consistent with those of the National ANS, which is to promote the advancement of science and engineering relating to the atomic nucleus and of allied sciences and arts.We are formed and managed by a group of students interested to contribute toward the development of nuclear science and technology at the University of California through activities in which student members and faculty may participate.Most of us are students in the Nuclear Engineering Department but we welcome students from all backgrounds to join us. The only requirements we ask for is a desire to learn and an open-mind for new technology.
We organize events for the benefit of our own members as well as to promote understanding of nuclear technology on campus. The recent focus of this society has been to increase public awareness of the many benefits of nuclear technology and its place in our future. With the increasing threats of nuclear terrorism, our aim is to educate the public on the safety issues and responsibilities related to nuclear power generation as well as the peaceful use of nuclear materials in medical radiation as well as food processing industries.
Our student section has sent many students to the ANS national conferences over the years. In 2002, UC Berkeley-ANS sponsored the National Student Conference for ANS and the conference was a tremendous success in bringing together students from all over the country to present information on latest technology in the field and to foster interaction between like-minded current and future scientists.
Our Mission
The American Nuclear Society serves its members in their efforts to develop and safely apply nuclear science and technology for public benefit through knowledge exchange, professional development, and enhanced public understanding.

Bay Area Optometric Council Mentorship Program at Berkeley",https://callink.berkeley.edu/organization/baocmentorship,,"The Bay Area Optometric Council Mentorship Program at Berkeley is a professional development initiative that aims to improve optometry student involvement in local optometric societies, California Optometric Association (COA), and American Optometric Association (AOA) through networking, legislative awareness, and career guidance.
(1) Networking:
For many students, it can be difficult to approach and initiate conversation with optometrists at networking events. We hope students will benefit more from attending meetings with a doctor who they can converse with during the event and help make the initial introductions to other optometrists. These students will in turn help their colleagues by opening the door for more students to enter the conversation.
(2) Legislative Awareness:
Optometry is a legislative profession that heavily relies on its advocates to improve scope of practice and community access to vision care. It is important to stress the importance of the students' role in local issues, COA, and AOA in order to improve participation in legislative activities through their school years and post-graduation. The Bay Area Optometric Council Mentorship Program at Berkeley seeks to involve students in local community events, legislative days, and general membership meeting business talks.
(3) Career Guidance:
The program’s mentors come from a wide variety of backgrounds and have varying modes of practice and specialties. Students will gain career guidance by shadowing their mentors and learning about how they have achieved success. Students are encouraged to talk to all mentors in the program, not just their own, to be exposed to a larger variety career options. Mentors can share what they wished they knew as a student and to make the most of their educational experience for their future goals.

From breaking gender roles in casting, to pushing away racial stereotypes, to even developing minority-based perspectives, A.N.T.I. strives to promote what a theatre company for actionable social change to the existing problems within the theatre industry can look like. While our goal for supporting inclusivity is related to many departments and clubs on campus, A.N.T.I. is different because our primary goal is to be inclusive and to create a theatre company on campus that specifically and primarily focuses on promoting the recognition of an individual's artistry, whether it be identity-based, politically-focused, or just artistic expression.

Or, learn new techniques and have a safe space to show off your work? If so, Caught on Film is the perfect place for you. This club is exclusive to film photography and gives students a way to grow their art and/or try out the medium for themselves.
Come learn more about the world of film through our general meetings, where we cover topics like developing, editing, and composition/shooting in depth. Beyond our workshops, enjoy club-wide events like photoshoots and socials to meet more film enthusiasts at Berkeley!
Our mission is to create an accessible and supportive pathway to film photography. Thus, as our club grows, we plan to reduce high financial barriers to the art by offering loaner cameras, discounted film stock, and in-house development. Any experience level is more than welcomed here at Caught on Film. Our workshops and events include photo critique sessions to help each other grow as photographers. Then, as a capstone event, get your work out to the public at an end-of-semester gallery!

As a team, we create and implement a variety of projects that help establish sustainable practices and promote environmental awareness on campus. Project committees within STeam work as a tight unit to accomplish their goals, and leadership capacity is shared equally.
We meet all together once a week to update each other on the progress of our projects and brainstorm strategies for successful implementation. The team also spends time outside of meetings through our STeam Socials and community service days a few times per semester.
Interested? Here are some of our current projects:
Ethical eats, one of our latest projects, centers around giving students access to sustainable restaurants. Our website grants sustainability ratings to local Berkeley eateries. Our team also performed paid research with a graduate student documenting single-use plastic surrounding restaurants. The grounds of this project rests on the belief that students should know how and where their food came to be and are given the proper resources to support sustainability in the food industry.
Another program STeam began is elementary education. We've collaborated with Connect-In-Place, a Berkeley-based e-learning initiative that connects college students with local middle- and high schools to teach courses! In the Fall of 2022, we will be teaching another course on reducing waste at home and at school through the platform. We firmly believe that change can be spurred from any age and it is vital to inform our future generations of our current environmental conditions. This team aims to inspire and educate kids to take action and live sustainably.
In Fall 2020, we organized a panel on the intersection between sustainability and racial justice, with activists, industry leaders, and academics attending to speak on the importance of intersectionality in their work. In Fall 2021, we hosted a workshop on communicating climate science to relatives, friends, and others close to you, emphasizing the importance of education and outreach in the fight for a sustainable future. 
Finally, STeam organizes Sunstock, a solar-powered music festival held on campus annually. STeam works hard year-round to prepare a venue, local lineup, sponsors, merchandise, and cuisine. Sunstock aims to unite students through music in an environmentally conscious way that brings light to improvements the music industry can make to be more sustainable. Our wide range of project niches displays how sustainability can be brought into all aspects of life and even combined with personal passions!
We are always open to new ideas. The next project we work on could be yours! So come check us out at our meetings and initiate your own ideas. Follow our instagram, @asuc.steam for meeting time updates and come to any meeting, no application necessary.

We are creative individuals who are continuously evolving by collaborating, inspiring, and educating one another. It is through our different artistic tools and talents that we are able to create novel photography and designs for our peers and professional clients.
We provide pro-bono creative services and teach popular DeCals to the Cal community. 
Website: https://www.innovativedesign.club/
Creative Services
Innovative Design has five tiers: Blue, Gold, Photo, Video, and Web. Throughout the semester, we also host several educational and industry events.
Gold and Blue: There are two design tiers, Gold and Blue Tier. Blue Tier is a group of intermediate to advanced designers that offers more professional design services while Gold Tier offers graphic design education and experience for beginner to intermediate designers as they service on-campus groups and professional clients.
Photo Tier provides members hands-on experience as they provide photography services such as shooting professional headshots, event photography, stock photos, and more.
Web Tier works for clients that are in need of technical help in designing their websites. Tier members learn new skills and put existing knowledge to use through hands-on experience.
DeCals 
Innovative Design teaches 3 DeCals:
Introduction to Photoshop and Illustrator
This introductory course teaches graphic design through the use of Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop. This class is built for students who do not have any prior experience or knowledge of these programs. We work with students in developing a thorough understanding of these programs with weekly lessons and hands-on tutorials. In addition, students complete relevant homework exercises which aim to give students the opportunity to practice tools, develop original designs, and channel their creativity. Lastly, we explore graphic design trends, principles, and applications.
Graphic Design Principles
This is a technical course in which students are taught extensive knowledge of Adobe programs (such as Illustrator and/or Photoshop). The class also covers conceptual and theoretical aspects of design such as color theory, branding, and user interface design. At the end of the course, students have a portfolio of work showcasing extensive knowledge on several design topics and an understanding of various elements of design.
Photography Principles
This DeCal is for students interested in learning photography. We start off with the basics (camera manipulations and shooting in RAW) and quickly move onto composition rules and tricks to get better, more thought out photos, and from there move onto how to be a professional photographer, photo ethics, and integrating art into photography.

Our mission is to educate members of our community on SVSH, reform our current culture to be more inclusive and aware of issues facing SVSH, and to advocate for those who are survivors in our campus community. This education may come in the form of workshops, roundtables, meetings, or other settings. This includes but is not limited to education about: consent, consent talks, privilege, power dynamics, bystander intervention, and national and local policies. GASA is committed to advocating for survivors of sexual violence and creating a survivor-centric CalGreeks and greater campus community.

We are the binding organization that ties all of the recognized fraternity chapters on campus. The number of fraternities is now over thrity, which amounts to approximately 1300 of the undergradute men at UC Berkeley. IFC serves chiefly as the official connection between the individual chapters and the University of California. As a council we are by and large self-governed through the efforts of representative delegates from each chapter, who work year long with the officers on IFC to strategize, plan, organize and execute short and long term goals to ensure the growth of the fraternity system at Cal.
IFC can also be thought of as the organization capable of doing things for the benefit of the entire community that no individual chapter has the resources to do on their own. We frequently engage in activities that include Greek-wide philanthropy and social events, public relations with the University and rest of the Berkeley community, risk management and safety of the entire community and Greek wide recruitment, to name a few.
Recruitment into IFC chapters is generally available at the beginning of every semester to every undergraduate male seeking to enhance their time at Cal by being a part of an organization that is truly greater than the sum of its parts. Greek members graduate with uncomparable experiences of the brotherhood, leadership opportunities and social life that is inherent in every chapter, regardless of the letters.

While our goal for supporting inclusivity is related to many departments and clubs on campus, A.N.T.I. is different because our primary goal is to be inclusive and to create a theatre company on campus that specifically and primarily focuses on promoting the recognition of an individual's artistry, whether it be identity-based, politically-focused, or just artistic expression.

The California chapter was founded 1905, having the distinction of being one of the oldest operating chapters in the National organization.
However, ""an organization is not necessarily good because it is old, but old because it is good."" There are a lot of great fraternities out there, and only you can decide which one is right for you. Here are a few reasons why Acacia Fraternity should be on your short list.
Acacia Emphasizes Academic Achievement
Academic achievement should be the first and foremost priority of all university students. It is also central to the mission of Acacia Fraternity, whose chapters stress academics above all else. Moreover, the Acacia Fraternity Foundation assists deserving Acacians with cash scholarships — over $250,000 in scholarships and educational grants were awarded by the foundation during the 2007-2008 academic year alone.
Acacia Develops Leaders
Acacia Fraternity is dedicated to building leaders by providing a wealth of leadership opportunities for our members. From social issues to academic, business to philanthropy, the Acacians of today are the leaders of tomorrow. Click here to view a list of prominent Acacians.
Acacians Help Better the Communities in Which We Reside
Our motto is ""Human Service,"" and we take it very seriously. As member of Acacia Fraternity you will have ongoing opportunities, through structured community service programs, to make a difference in the lives of those in need.
Acacians Value Fitness
Members of Acacia are encouraged to participate in intramural sports, a system in which athletes of all caliber find camaraderie and physical challenge. Whatever the sport, and whatever your skill level, as a member of Acacia you will always have a place on the team.
Acacians Know How to Have Fun
Forget the ""Animal House"" stereotype of reckless partying and irresponsible behavior. Acacia's policy is that each chapter maintains a fun yet responsible social policy that promotes responsible choices and the dignity of every individual as well as zero tolerance for illegal activities.

ATO was founded at the Virginia Military Institute by three cadets who sought to create a brotherhood based on eternal and immutable principles to unite men and heal the divisions caused by the war. 
ATO continues to reinforce these principles today, as embodied in the fraternity's creed:
""To bind men together in a brotherhood based upon eternal and immutable principles, with a bond as strong as right itself and as lasting as humanity; to know no North, no South, no East, no West, but to know man as man, to teach that true men the world over should stand together and contend for supremacy of good over evil; to teach, not politics, but morals; to foster, not partisanship, but the recognition of true merit wherever found; to have no narrower limits within which to work together for the elevation of man than the outlines of the world: these were the thoughts and hopes uppermost in the minds of the founders of the Alpha Tau Omega Fraternity.""
The Gamma Iota Chapter of Alpha Tau Omega at UC Berkeley has received several awards ranging from academic to athletic successes. We provide an excellent way to delve into a rich life at Berkeley with socials with sororities, brotherhood retreats, philanthropy events, club nights, sporting nights, and a whole lot more. We have consistently successful intramural teams in basketball, football, soccer, softball, and volleyball.
We live in the largest fraternity house on campus, which has been recently renovated and is well taken care of. Our brothers are diverse in their backgrounds and their studies - we are open to all who are charismatic and outgoing.
Our alumni range in successes from former US Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens, the Vice President of Fox Sports, a major Hollywood talent agent, a world class anesthesiologist, a senior partner at Goldman Sachs (who was named by Haas as the Business Leader of the Year for 2014), and a former California superior court judge. 
One of ATO's most notable contributions to Cal is the original Oski. Oski was a bear cub who lived in the ATO house in 1923 until he grew too large and was moved to the Oakland Zoo.

This Alpha (chapter) of Chi Psi at the University of California, Berkeley was founded in 1895, making it one of the oldest and richest traditions on campus. Our Fraternity is composed of undergraduate students from across a wide range of disciplines and backgrounds, brought together by a mutual desire and respect for brotherhood. We support and inspire one another to succeed, despite the competitive academic atmosphere at Berkeley. We maintain a prominent building (The Lodge) on Piedmont Ave, a robust social calendar, intense involvement in campus life, and a dynamic alumni base right here in the Bay Area that provides career support and guidance.
Most importantly, Chi Psi is a brotherhood of gentlemen in the pursuit of excellence. Since our inception more than 175 years ago, the only requirement for membership has always been that one displays the characteristics of a gentleman. By committing ourselves to the values associated with this pursuit, we help young men mature into responsible, compassionate, and confident members of the greater community. 
Furthermore, we are committed to maintaining a diverse, equitable, and inclusive brotherhood that welcomes all kinds of gentleman. We respect and acknowledge our brothers' diverse experiences, and are strong in our unity.

This year, Alternative Breaks offers seven trips to different locations during the spring break, covering issues such as environmental justice, health care, immigration, and housing insecurity.
These student-led trips travel to different locations in California and Puerto Rico to further their understanding of the community and to bring knowledge gained on-site back to the Berkeley community. Students not only participate in a week-long service trip, but also a spring DeCal course to explore various topics revolving around each social justice issue and engage in reflection both pre- and post-trip.

IFC can also be thought of as the organization capable of doing things for the benefit of the entire community that no individual chapter has the resources to do on their own.

The California chapter was founded 1905, having the distinction of being one of the oldest operating chapters in the National organization.
However, ""an organization is not necessarily good because it is old, but old because it is good."" There are a lot of great fraternities out there, and only you can decide which one is right for you. Here are a few reasons why Acacia Fraternity should be on your short list.
Acacia Emphasizes Academic Achievement
Academic achievement should be the first and foremost priority of all university students. It is also central to the mission of Acacia Fraternity, whose chapters stress academics above all else. Moreover, the Acacia Fraternity Foundation assists deserving Acacians with cash scholarships — over $250,000 in scholarships and educational grants were awarded by the foundation during the 2007-2008 academic year alone.
Acacia Develops Leaders
Acacia Fraternity is dedicated to building leaders by providing a wealth of leadership opportunities for our members. From social issues to academic, business to philanthropy, the Acacians of today are the leaders of tomorrow. Click here to view a list of prominent Acacians.
Acacians Help Better the Communities in Which We Reside
Our motto is ""Human Service,"" and we take it very seriously. As member of Acacia Fraternity you will have ongoing opportunities, through structured community service programs, to make a difference in the lives of those in need.
Acacians Value Fitness
Members of Acacia are encouraged to participate in intramural sports, a system in which athletes of all caliber find camaraderie and physical challenge. Whatever the sport, and whatever your skill level, as a member of Acacia you will always have a place on the team.
Acacians Know How to Have Fun
Forget the ""Animal House"" stereotype of reckless partying and irresponsible behavior. Acacia's policy is that each chapter maintains a fun yet responsible social policy that promotes responsible choices and the dignity of every individual as well as zero tolerance for illegal activities.

Established in 1986, Lambda Theta Nu Sorority, Inc. continues to provide its members with a support system based on academic excellence, community service, and sisterhood. 
The purpose of Lambda Theta Nu Sorority, Inc. is to open the doors of opportunity to the Latinas of our community. Our primary focus is academic excellence and meeting the needs of Latina women in higher education. Lambda Theta Nu Sorority, Inc. also promotes the advancement of Latinas through various campus activities and community services, and provides an environment for personal growth within a unit of sisterhood. Lambda Theta Nu Sorority, Inc.'s priorities, however, will be placed upon academic excellence and community service.
Divine Delta Chapter | University of California, Berkeley | Est. April 6, 1991
In the Spring of 1991 three strong, brave, and intelligent Latina women, Jennifer Garcia, Maria Martinez, and Rosalinda Valdez felt the need to establish an organization that supplemented their needs as women in higher education at UC Berkeley. This need led to the formation of the Delta chapter of Lambda Theta Nu Sorority, Inc., and the establishment of the first Latina organization at UC Berkeley. Twenty-seven years later, the Delta chapter continues it's commitment to academic excellence, community service, and sisterhood. Although we are a Latina-based sorority, we accept applicants regardless of race or color, national origin, religion, sexual orientation or handicap.
Pillars 
Academic Excellence, Community Service, Sisterhood 
Traditions
Stepping: In 1987 the sisters of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc. first introduced stepping to ladies of Lambda Theta Nu sorority Inc. by inviting them to step on stage in a unity step. Our sisters at California State University, Chico added the use of machetes as a symbol of strength, a symbol with direct cultural ties.
Machetes: In 1989 Lambda Theta Nu Sorority, Inc. became the first sorority to incorporate the use of machetes in a stepping performance. The use of machetes has traditionally showcased the bravery of men. However, for Lambdas, breaking down this male-based tradition not only served as symbol of empowerment but also exemplified the determination of Latinas to integrate into every aspect of life that was not traditionally meant for Latinas. The incorporation of machetes in our performances personify our culture and our strength as women whose perseverance is multidimensional.
Strolling: Strolling, also known as party walking, is a synchronized dance used to encourage commonalities among sisters and showcase our organization and/or to compete in shows.

On December 1, 1975, Lambda Theta Phi was founded on the campus of Kean College in Union, New Jersey.

The ideals of this brotherhood are the following: Academic Excellence; Brotherhood; Leadership; Latino Unity; Service. On a daily basis, our brothers live up to these ideals, as set forth by fourteen young Latino men decades ago. 

Since our founding, Lambda Theta Phi has established chapters in every region of the country at both the undergraduate and professional levels. Our brotherhood continues to provide the necessary skills and resources for the advancement and empowerment of our people and for the betterment of this nation. 

The University of California, Berkeley was home to the newest chapter of Lambda Theta Phi, Latin Fraternity, Inc. in the Spring semester of 2004. Ten undergraduate students came together with the idea of introducing a positive image of a Latino fraternity to the UC Berkeley campus. They wanted to embrace and take part in the unity, brotherhood, pride and respect for all cultures that Lambda Theta Phi offered.

On May 9, 2004, Luis Sanchez, Renato Manay, Renzo Manay, Arquimides Pacheco, and Rafael Hernandez created a historical landmark and established the first Latino Greek Letter Fraternity officially recognized by the National Interfraternal Council (NIC) on the UC Berkeley campus.

Now, since its establishment and through its further development and growth, Lambda Theta Phi in UC Berkeley has continued to carry through its ideals of a service/social fraternity by giving back to the community while engaging in social activities that would allow further bondages among our members and with other organizations. Such include our participation in the Annual AIDS Walk, our service in low-income Oakland Elementary schools, and advocacy of immigrant rights to day laborers within the county of Alameda. Apart from these community service events, this chapter has sought to create strong ties and mutual respect with other Latin and non-Latin organizations through social activities and collaborative efforts.

Lastly, the main goal of Lambda Theta Phi in UC Berkeley is to pursue the educational success of our fraternity brothers. At the national level, from New Jersey to California, many go on to become doctors, lawyers, engineers, among other professionals.

They brought forth this beautiful organization in order to uplift women of color at Cal through sisterhood, mutual support, & love. We hope that bringing Phi Lambda Rho to Berkeley will create a supportive sanctuary within this historically white-serving institution for the growing number of Latinas on campus to flourish.
Phi Lambda Rho Sorority Inc., is a multi-cultural Chicana/Latina sorority popularly known as “Rhosas” or “Rhos.” Sisters of Phi Lambda Rho organize and execute events catered to their four pillars -- Academics, Cultura, Philanthropy, and Sisterhood --throughout the year, making them an active and professional sorority in the community.

The sorority serves as a retention group for aspiring young women in college who wish to leave a positive impact in their communities by engaging in service to the community while displaying a sense of cultural pride and fostering life-long bonds.

ATO was founded at the Virginia Military Institute by three cadets who sought to create a brotherhood based on eternal and immutable principles to unite men and heal the divisions caused by the war. 
ATO continues to reinforce these principles today, as embodied in the fraternity's creed:
""To bind men together in a brotherhood based upon eternal and immutable principles, with a bond as strong as right itself and as lasting as humanity; to know no North, no South, no East, no West, but to know man as man, to teach that true men the world over should stand together and contend for supremacy of good over evil; to teach, not politics, but morals; to foster, not partisanship, but the recognition of true merit wherever found; to have no narrower limits within which to work together for the elevation of man than the outlines of the world: these were the thoughts and hopes uppermost in the minds of the founders of the Alpha Tau Omega Fraternity.""
The Gamma Iota Chapter of Alpha Tau Omega at UC Berkeley has received several awards ranging from academic to athletic successes. We provide an excellent way to delve into a rich life at Berkeley with socials with sororities, brotherhood retreats, philanthropy events, club nights, sporting nights, and a whole lot more. We have consistently successful intramural teams in basketball, football, soccer, softball, and volleyball.
We live in the largest fraternity house on campus, which has been recently renovated and is well taken care of. Our brothers are diverse in their backgrounds and their studies - we are open to all who are charismatic and outgoing.
Our alumni range in successes from former US Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens, the Vice President of Fox Sports, a major Hollywood talent agent, a world class anesthesiologist, a senior partner at Goldman Sachs (who was named by Haas as the Business Leader of the Year for 2014), and a former California superior court judge. 
One of ATO's most notable contributions to Cal is the original Oski. Oski was a bear cub who lived in the ATO house in 1923 until he grew too large and was moved to the Oakland Zoo.

This Alpha (chapter) of Chi Psi at the University of California, Berkeley was founded in 1895, making it one of the oldest and richest traditions on campus. Our Fraternity is composed of undergraduate students from across a wide range of disciplines and backgrounds, brought together by a mutual desire and respect for brotherhood. We support and inspire one another to succeed, despite the competitive academic atmosphere at Berkeley. We maintain a prominent building (The Lodge) on Piedmont Ave, a robust social calendar, intense involvement in campus life, and a dynamic alumni base right here in the Bay Area that provides career support and guidance.
Most importantly, Chi Psi is a brotherhood of gentlemen in the pursuit of excellence. Since our inception more than 175 years ago, the only requirement for membership has always been that one displays the characteristics of a gentleman. By committing ourselves to the values associated with this pursuit, we help young men mature into responsible, compassionate, and confident members of the greater community. 
Furthermore, we are committed to maintaining a diverse, equitable, and inclusive brotherhood that welcomes all kinds of gentleman. We respect and acknowledge our brothers' diverse experiences, and are strong in our unity.

This year, Alternative Breaks offers seven trips to different locations during the spring break, covering issues such as environmental justice, health care, immigration, and housing insecurity.
These student-led trips travel to different locations in California and Puerto Rico to further their understanding of the community and to bring knowledge gained on-site back to the Berkeley community. Students not only participate in a week-long service trip, but also a spring DeCal course to explore various topics revolving around each social justice issue and engage in reflection both pre- and post-trip.

IFC serves chiefly as the official connection between the individual chapters and the University of California. As a council we are by and large self-governed through the efforts of representative delegates from each chapter, who work year long with the officers on IFC to strategize, plan, organize and execute short and long term goals to ensure the growth of the fraternity system at Cal.
IFC can also be thought of as the organization capable of doing things for the benefit of the entire community that no individual chapter has the resources to do on their own. We frequently engage in activities that include Greek-wide philanthropy and social events, public relations with the University and rest of the Berkeley community, risk management and safety of the entire community and Greek wide recruitment, to name a few.
Recruitment into IFC chapters is generally available at the beginning of every semester to every undergraduate male seeking to enhance their time at Cal by being a part of an organization that is truly greater than the sum of its parts. Greek members graduate with uncomparable experiences of the brotherhood, leadership opportunities and social life that is inherent in every chapter, regardless of the letters.

The phrase was selected as the motto. Manhood, Scholarship, Perseverance and Uplift were adopted as cardinal principles.

The California chapter was founded 1905, having the distinction of being one of the oldest operating chapters in the National organization.
However, ""an organization is not necessarily good because it is old, but old because it is good."" There are a lot of great fraternities out there, and only you can decide which one is right for you. Here are a few reasons why Acacia Fraternity should be on your short list.
Acacia Emphasizes Academic Achievement
Academic achievement should be the first and foremost priority of all university students. It is also central to the mission of Acacia Fraternity, whose chapters stress academics above all else. Moreover, the Acacia Fraternity Foundation assists deserving Acacians with cash scholarships — over $250,000 in scholarships and educational grants were awarded by the foundation during the 2007-2008 academic year alone.
Acacia Develops Leaders
Acacia Fraternity is dedicated to building leaders by providing a wealth of leadership opportunities for our members. From social issues to academic, business to philanthropy, the Acacians of today are the leaders of tomorrow. Click here to view a list of prominent Acacians.
Acacians Help Better the Communities in Which We Reside
Our motto is ""Human Service,"" and we take it very seriously. As member of Acacia Fraternity you will have ongoing opportunities, through structured community service programs, to make a difference in the lives of those in need.
Acacians Value Fitness
Members of Acacia are encouraged to participate in intramural sports, a system in which athletes of all caliber find camaraderie and physical challenge. Whatever the sport, and whatever your skill level, as a member of Acacia you will always have a place on the team.
Acacians Know How to Have Fun
Forget the ""Animal House"" stereotype of reckless partying and irresponsible behavior. Acacia's policy is that each chapter maintains a fun yet responsible social policy that promotes responsible choices and the dignity of every individual as well as zero tolerance for illegal activities.

The strong bond that we possess among our 23 chapters statewide makes the brotherhood experience unlike any other Greek organization on campus.

Established in 1986, Lambda Theta Nu Sorority, Inc. continues to provide its members with a support system based on academic excellence, community service, and sisterhood. 
The purpose of Lambda Theta Nu Sorority, Inc. is to open the doors of opportunity to the Latinas of our community. Our primary focus is academic excellence and meeting the needs of Latina women in higher education. Lambda Theta Nu Sorority, Inc. also promotes the advancement of Latinas through various campus activities and community services, and provides an environment for personal growth within a unit of sisterhood. Lambda Theta Nu Sorority, Inc.'s priorities, however, will be placed upon academic excellence and community service.
Divine Delta Chapter | University of California, Berkeley | Est. April 6, 1991
In the Spring of 1991 three strong, brave, and intelligent Latina women, Jennifer Garcia, Maria Martinez, and Rosalinda Valdez felt the need to establish an organization that supplemented their needs as women in higher education at UC Berkeley. This need led to the formation of the Delta chapter of Lambda Theta Nu Sorority, Inc., and the establishment of the first Latina organization at UC Berkeley. Twenty-seven years later, the Delta chapter continues it's commitment to academic excellence, community service, and sisterhood. Although we are a Latina-based sorority, we accept applicants regardless of race or color, national origin, religion, sexual orientation or handicap.
Pillars 
Academic Excellence, Community Service, Sisterhood 
Traditions
Stepping: In 1987 the sisters of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc. first introduced stepping to ladies of Lambda Theta Nu sorority Inc. by inviting them to step on stage in a unity step. Our sisters at California State University, Chico added the use of machetes as a symbol of strength, a symbol with direct cultural ties.
Machetes: In 1989 Lambda Theta Nu Sorority, Inc. became the first sorority to incorporate the use of machetes in a stepping performance. The use of machetes has traditionally showcased the bravery of men. However, for Lambdas, breaking down this male-based tradition not only served as symbol of empowerment but also exemplified the determination of Latinas to integrate into every aspect of life that was not traditionally meant for Latinas. The incorporation of machetes in our performances personify our culture and our strength as women whose perseverance is multidimensional.
Strolling: Strolling, also known as party walking, is a synchronized dance used to encourage commonalities among sisters and showcase our organization and/or to compete in shows.

On December 1, 1975, Lambda Theta Phi was founded on the campus of Kean College in Union, New Jersey.

The ideals of this brotherhood are the following: Academic Excellence; Brotherhood; Leadership; Latino Unity; Service. On a daily basis, our brothers live up to these ideals, as set forth by fourteen young Latino men decades ago. 

Since our founding, Lambda Theta Phi has established chapters in every region of the country at both the undergraduate and professional levels. Our brotherhood continues to provide the necessary skills and resources for the advancement and empowerment of our people and for the betterment of this nation. 

The University of California, Berkeley was home to the newest chapter of Lambda Theta Phi, Latin Fraternity, Inc. in the Spring semester of 2004. Ten undergraduate students came together with the idea of introducing a positive image of a Latino fraternity to the UC Berkeley campus. They wanted to embrace and take part in the unity, brotherhood, pride and respect for all cultures that Lambda Theta Phi offered.

On May 9, 2004, Luis Sanchez, Renato Manay, Renzo Manay, Arquimides Pacheco, and Rafael Hernandez created a historical landmark and established the first Latino Greek Letter Fraternity officially recognized by the National Interfraternal Council (NIC) on the UC Berkeley campus.

Now, since its establishment and through its further development and growth, Lambda Theta Phi in UC Berkeley has continued to carry through its ideals of a service/social fraternity by giving back to the community while engaging in social activities that would allow further bondages among our members and with other organizations. Such include our participation in the Annual AIDS Walk, our service in low-income Oakland Elementary schools, and advocacy of immigrant rights to day laborers within the county of Alameda. Apart from these community service events, this chapter has sought to create strong ties and mutual respect with other Latin and non-Latin organizations through social activities and collaborative efforts.

Lastly, the main goal of Lambda Theta Phi in UC Berkeley is to pursue the educational success of our fraternity brothers. At the national level, from New Jersey to California, many go on to become doctors, lawyers, engineers, among other professionals.

Phi Lambda Rho Sorority Inc., is a multi-cultural Chicana/Latina sorority popularly known as “Rhosas” or “Rhos.” Sisters of Phi Lambda Rho organize and execute events catered to their four pillars -- Academics, Cultura, Philanthropy, and Sisterhood --throughout the year, making them an active and professional sorority in the community.

The sorority serves as a retention group for aspiring young women in college who wish to leave a positive impact in their communities by engaging in service to the community while displaying a sense of cultural pride and fostering life-long bonds.

ATO was founded at the Virginia Military Institute by three cadets who sought to create a brotherhood based on eternal and immutable principles to unite men and heal the divisions caused by the war. 
ATO continues to reinforce these principles today, as embodied in the fraternity's creed:
""To bind men together in a brotherhood based upon eternal and immutable principles, with a bond as strong as right itself and as lasting as humanity; to know no North, no South, no East, no West, but to know man as man, to teach that true men the world over should stand together and contend for supremacy of good over evil; to teach, not politics, but morals; to foster, not partisanship, but the recognition of true merit wherever found; to have no narrower limits within which to work together for the elevation of man than the outlines of the world: these were the thoughts and hopes uppermost in the minds of the founders of the Alpha Tau Omega Fraternity.""
The Gamma Iota Chapter of Alpha Tau Omega at UC Berkeley has received several awards ranging from academic to athletic successes. We provide an excellent way to delve into a rich life at Berkeley with socials with sororities, brotherhood retreats, philanthropy events, club nights, sporting nights, and a whole lot more. We have consistently successful intramural teams in basketball, football, soccer, softball, and volleyball.
We live in the largest fraternity house on campus, which has been recently renovated and is well taken care of. Our brothers are diverse in their backgrounds and their studies - we are open to all who are charismatic and outgoing.
Our alumni range in successes from former US Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens, the Vice President of Fox Sports, a major Hollywood talent agent, a world class anesthesiologist, a senior partner at Goldman Sachs (who was named by Haas as the Business Leader of the Year for 2014), and a former California superior court judge. 
One of ATO's most notable contributions to Cal is the original Oski. Oski was a bear cub who lived in the ATO house in 1923 until he grew too large and was moved to the Oakland Zoo.

By committing ourselves to the values associated with this pursuit, we help young men mature into responsible, compassionate, and confident members of the greater community.

The Fraternity teaches men that these areas of commitment, outlined in The Bond of Phi Delta Theta, are not to be viewed as separate ideals, but as areas of discipline for daily life. Developments intellectually, in leadership, and human service (to name a few) are vital to the men of Phi Delta Theta.

We are the binding organization that ties all of the recognized fraternity chapters on campus. The number of fraternities is now over thrity, which amounts to approximately 1300 of the undergradute men at UC Berkeley. IFC serves chiefly as the official connection between the individual chapters and the University of California. As a council we are by and large self-governed through the efforts of representative delegates from each chapter, who work year long with the officers on IFC to strategize, plan, organize and execute short and long term goals to ensure the growth of the fraternity system at Cal.
IFC can also be thought of as the organization capable of doing things for the benefit of the entire community that no individual chapter has the resources to do on their own. We frequently engage in activities that include Greek-wide philanthropy and social events, public relations with the University and rest of the Berkeley community, risk management and safety of the entire community and Greek wide recruitment, to name a few.
Recruitment into IFC chapters is generally available at the beginning of every semester to every undergraduate male seeking to enhance their time at Cal by being a part of an organization that is truly greater than the sum of its parts. Greek members graduate with uncomparable experiences of the brotherhood, leadership opportunities and social life that is inherent in every chapter, regardless of the letters.

Alpha Chi Omega was founded on October 15, 1885 by seven amazing women at DePauw University in Greencastle, Indiana. Anna Allen, Olive Burnett, Bertha Denison, Amy DuBois, Nellie Gamble, Bessie Grooms, and Estelle Leonard founded Alpha Chi. It was the first, and most likely last, musical fraternity. The group was thus named Alpha, meaning first, and Omega, meaning last, using Chi as a link. The purpose of Alpha Chi Omega was to provide the advancement of the intellectual, social, and moral culture of its members. The Berkeley AXO Pi Chapter was founded on May 7, 1909.

  Alpha Delta Pi was founded by Eugenia Tucker in 1851 at the Wesleyan Female College in Macon Georgia. It holds the distinction of being the first secret society for women, and therefore the foundation of the entire sorority system, hence our motto- First, Finest, Forever.
  Psi Chapter of ADPi was founded in Berkeley in 1913- the 23rd national chapter to be established. In 1931, the chapter purchased our current home, 2400 Piedmont Ave. The house was formerly the summer home of notable Bay Area heiress Phoebe Hearst, and was recognized immediately as the showplace of the campus.
Since then, the mansion has had several modern conveniences added on, but it still retains its original character. It serves as a charming home to almost sixty girls.
  With its location on Channing circle, Psi chapter of Alpha Delta Pi lies at the very heart of the present-day Greek community.

Service for Sight supports the four schools founded by Delta Gammas for the visually impaired and other North American organizations that promote sight preservation and provide assistance to children and adults who are blind or visually impaired. This philanthropy has been at the heart of the Delta Gamma mission since 1936 when a member who was blind, Ruth Billow, Eta-Akron, petitioned members to adopt ""Aid to the Blind"" as our official philanthropy.

The compassion and drive of Delta Sigmas extends far beyond our home at 2311 Prospect Street. Delta Sigmas are leaders on campus and in the UC Berkeley Greek community.
From Cal’s cheerleading team, to Berkeley’s Society of Women Engineers, to the Berkeley Business Society, to Cal’s Campus Ambassador program, you can find our members in leadership positions in over 100 campus organizations. As a chapter, we’ve achieved one of the highest G.P.A. ranks, exceeding the all-campus average, all-women average, and the all-PHC-Greek average. In addition to supporting our sisters in their diverse extracurricular involvements, we love going out together for football games and pep rallies, hosting philanthropy fundraisers, and attending formal social events in San Francisco! You can spot us having Friday morning brunch on our deck enjoying the beautiful place we call home!

Of course, you will make lifelong friends here – and in the future after college. But it’s here you will have the opportunity for individual growth through academic excellence, leadership development, social enrichment and philanthropic involvement that will take you wherever you want to go with your life. 

We believe that the result of contribution to community, developing moral and ethical integrity in all aspects of life, and striving for excellence in all levels of your endeavors are elements that one learns as a part of sorority life. Being part of a social organization is also an important ""fun"" aspect of college life. 

Becoming self-reliant, looking inward toward sisterhood for support and celebrating your individualism are benefits not found in many other organizations.

Every member is selected to life membership. This choice of membership does not relate simply to one college campus or community, for every member belongs to the International Sorority and enjoys a member’s rights, privileges and responsibilities wherever she may live, study, work or travel. As a member, you have the opportunity to be a part of a sisterhood that has blossomed from Four Founders to over 140,000 members with 114 collegiate chapters and 156 alumnae chapters.

Theta has over 170 chapters with houses throughout the United States and Canada. More than 250,000 women have been initiated into Kappa Alpha Theta, forming strong friendships in chapters from all over, holding the sisterhood strong. The Omega Chapter was founded at University of California, Berkeley in 1890. Our Chapter occupied the first women's chapter house built by Omega sister Julia Morgan, the first woman to study architecture at the Ecole de Beaux Arts in Paris. 
  Kappa Alpha Theta is proud to be national supporters of Court Appointed Special Advocates (CASA). CASA is an organization that provides mentors for abused, abandoned and neglected children. These mentors establish close bonds with the children as they interact one-on-one and serve as a voice for the children during the judicial process.
The Omega chapter of Kappa AlphaTheta supports CASA in a number of ways including donations from our annual philanthropic fundraising events, Theta Dodgeball and Cafe Casa (our famous Theta Brunch held at our beautiful Theta home, open to the Berkeley community).

However, ""an organization is not necessarily good because it is old, but old because it is good."" There are a lot of great fraternities out there, and only you can decide which one is right for you. Here are a few reasons why Acacia Fraternity should be on your short list.
Acacia Emphasizes Academic Achievement
Academic achievement should be the first and foremost priority of all university students. It is also central to the mission of Acacia Fraternity, whose chapters stress academics above all else. Moreover, the Acacia Fraternity Foundation assists deserving Acacians with cash scholarships — over $250,000 in scholarships and educational grants were awarded by the foundation during the 2007-2008 academic year alone.
Acacia Develops Leaders
Acacia Fraternity is dedicated to building leaders by providing a wealth of leadership opportunities for our members. From social issues to academic, business to philanthropy, the Acacians of today are the leaders of tomorrow. Click here to view a list of prominent Acacians.
Acacians Help Better the Communities in Which We Reside
Our motto is ""Human Service,"" and we take it very seriously. As member of Acacia Fraternity you will have ongoing opportunities, through structured community service programs, to make a difference in the lives of those in need.
Acacians Value Fitness
Members of Acacia are encouraged to participate in intramural sports, a system in which athletes of all caliber find camaraderie and physical challenge. Whatever the sport, and whatever your skill level, as a member of Acacia you will always have a place on the team.
Acacians Know How to Have Fun
Forget the ""Animal House"" stereotype of reckless partying and irresponsible behavior. Acacia's policy is that each chapter maintains a fun yet responsible social policy that promotes responsible choices and the dignity of every individual as well as zero tolerance for illegal activities.

Our sisters at California State University, Chico added the use of machetes as a symbol of strength, a symbol with direct cultural ties.
Machetes: In 1989 Lambda Theta Nu Sorority, Inc. became the first sorority to incorporate the use of machetes in a stepping performance. The use of machetes has traditionally showcased the bravery of men. However, for Lambdas, breaking down this male-based tradition not only served as symbol of empowerment but also exemplified the determination of Latinas to integrate into every aspect of life that was not traditionally meant for Latinas. The incorporation of machetes in our performances personify our culture and our strength as women whose perseverance is multidimensional.
Strolling: Strolling, also known as party walking, is a synchronized dance used to encourage commonalities among sisters and showcase our organization and/or to compete in shows.

On December 1, 1975, Lambda Theta Phi was founded on the campus of Kean College in Union, New Jersey.

The ideals of this brotherhood are the following: Academic Excellence; Brotherhood; Leadership; Latino Unity; Service. On a daily basis, our brothers live up to these ideals, as set forth by fourteen young Latino men decades ago. 

Since our founding, Lambda Theta Phi has established chapters in every region of the country at both the undergraduate and professional levels. Our brotherhood continues to provide the necessary skills and resources for the advancement and empowerment of our people and for the betterment of this nation. 

The University of California, Berkeley was home to the newest chapter of Lambda Theta Phi, Latin Fraternity, Inc. in the Spring semester of 2004. Ten undergraduate students came together with the idea of introducing a positive image of a Latino fraternity to the UC Berkeley campus. They wanted to embrace and take part in the unity, brotherhood, pride and respect for all cultures that Lambda Theta Phi offered.

On May 9, 2004, Luis Sanchez, Renato Manay, Renzo Manay, Arquimides Pacheco, and Rafael Hernandez created a historical landmark and established the first Latino Greek Letter Fraternity officially recognized by the National Interfraternal Council (NIC) on the UC Berkeley campus.

Now, since its establishment and through its further development and growth, Lambda Theta Phi in UC Berkeley has continued to carry through its ideals of a service/social fraternity by giving back to the community while engaging in social activities that would allow further bondages among our members and with other organizations. Such include our participation in the Annual AIDS Walk, our service in low-income Oakland Elementary schools, and advocacy of immigrant rights to day laborers within the county of Alameda. Apart from these community service events, this chapter has sought to create strong ties and mutual respect with other Latin and non-Latin organizations through social activities and collaborative efforts.

Lastly, the main goal of Lambda Theta Phi in UC Berkeley is to pursue the educational success of our fraternity brothers. At the national level, from New Jersey to California, many go on to become doctors, lawyers, engineers, among other professionals.

We hope that bringing Phi Lambda Rho to Berkeley will create a supportive sanctuary within this historically white-serving institution for the growing number of Latinas on campus to flourish.
Phi Lambda Rho Sorority Inc., is a multi-cultural Chicana/Latina sorority popularly known as “Rhosas” or “Rhos.” Sisters of Phi Lambda Rho organize and execute events catered to their four pillars -- Academics, Cultura, Philanthropy, and Sisterhood --throughout the year, making them an active and professional sorority in the community.

The sorority serves as a retention group for aspiring young women in college who wish to leave a positive impact in their communities by engaging in service to the community while displaying a sense of cultural pride and fostering life-long bonds.

ATO was founded at the Virginia Military Institute by three cadets who sought to create a brotherhood based on eternal and immutable principles to unite men and heal the divisions caused by the war. 
ATO continues to reinforce these principles today, as embodied in the fraternity's creed:
""To bind men together in a brotherhood based upon eternal and immutable principles, with a bond as strong as right itself and as lasting as humanity; to know no North, no South, no East, no West, but to know man as man, to teach that true men the world over should stand together and contend for supremacy of good over evil; to teach, not politics, but morals; to foster, not partisanship, but the recognition of true merit wherever found; to have no narrower limits within which to work together for the elevation of man than the outlines of the world: these were the thoughts and hopes uppermost in the minds of the founders of the Alpha Tau Omega Fraternity.""
The Gamma Iota Chapter of Alpha Tau Omega at UC Berkeley has received several awards ranging from academic to athletic successes. We provide an excellent way to delve into a rich life at Berkeley with socials with sororities, brotherhood retreats, philanthropy events, club nights, sporting nights, and a whole lot more. We have consistently successful intramural teams in basketball, football, soccer, softball, and volleyball.
We live in the largest fraternity house on campus, which has been recently renovated and is well taken care of. Our brothers are diverse in their backgrounds and their studies - we are open to all who are charismatic and outgoing.
Our alumni range in successes from former US Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens, the Vice President of Fox Sports, a major Hollywood talent agent, a world class anesthesiologist, a senior partner at Goldman Sachs (who was named by Haas as the Business Leader of the Year for 2014), and a former California superior court judge. 
One of ATO's most notable contributions to Cal is the original Oski. Oski was a bear cub who lived in the ATO house in 1923 until he grew too large and was moved to the Oakland Zoo.

This Alpha (chapter) of Chi Psi at the University of California, Berkeley was founded in 1895, making it one of the oldest and richest traditions on campus. Our Fraternity is composed of undergraduate students from across a wide range of disciplines and backgrounds, brought together by a mutual desire and respect for brotherhood. We support and inspire one another to succeed, despite the competitive academic atmosphere at Berkeley. We maintain a prominent building (The Lodge) on Piedmont Ave, a robust social calendar, intense involvement in campus life, and a dynamic alumni base right here in the Bay Area that provides career support and guidance.
Most importantly, Chi Psi is a brotherhood of gentlemen in the pursuit of excellence. Since our inception more than 175 years ago, the only requirement for membership has always been that one displays the characteristics of a gentleman. By committing ourselves to the values associated with this pursuit, we help young men mature into responsible, compassionate, and confident members of the greater community. 
Furthermore, we are committed to maintaining a diverse, equitable, and inclusive brotherhood that welcomes all kinds of gentleman. We respect and acknowledge our brothers' diverse experiences, and are strong in our unity.

The Fraternity teaches men that these areas of commitment, outlined in The Bond of Phi Delta Theta, are not to be viewed as separate ideals, but as areas of discipline for daily life. Developments intellectually, in leadership, and human service (to name a few) are vital to the men of Phi Delta Theta.

Real. Strong. Women.
Alpha Chi Omega was founded on October 15, 1885 by seven amazing women at DePauw University in Greencastle, Indiana. Anna Allen, Olive Burnett, Bertha Denison, Amy DuBois, Nellie Gamble, Bessie Grooms, and Estelle Leonard founded Alpha Chi. It was the first, and most likely last, musical fraternity. The group was thus named Alpha, meaning first, and Omega, meaning last, using Chi as a link. The purpose of Alpha Chi Omega was to provide the advancement of the intellectual, social, and moral culture of its members. The Berkeley AXO Pi Chapter was founded on May 7, 1909.

  Alpha Delta Pi was founded by Eugenia Tucker in 1851 at the Wesleyan Female College in Macon Georgia. It holds the distinction of being the first secret society for women, and therefore the foundation of the entire sorority system, hence our motto- First, Finest, Forever.
  Psi Chapter of ADPi was founded in Berkeley in 1913- the 23rd national chapter to be established. In 1931, the chapter purchased our current home, 2400 Piedmont Ave. The house was formerly the summer home of notable Bay Area heiress Phoebe Hearst, and was recognized immediately as the showplace of the campus.
Since then, the mansion has had several modern conveniences added on, but it still retains its original character. It serves as a charming home to almost sixty girls.
  With its location on Channing circle, Psi chapter of Alpha Delta Pi lies at the very heart of the present-day Greek community.

Whether by providing scholarship funds through the Foundation to assist with educational costs, or by promoting academic success through a chapter’s Academic Excellence Initiative, Tri Delta offers encouragement and support to collegiate members as they pursue academic achievement.
PHILANTHROPY
Members of Tri Delta have a long history of supporting children’s cancer charities at the local level with local children’s hospitals and at the national level with our philanthropic partner, St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital. The Fraternity and its chapters also consistently provide opportunities to raise funds to support the Tri Delta Foundation. This emphasis on philanthropy and service allows our members to develop qualities of unselfish leadership and assume the highest responsibilities of college women.
MEMBER DEVELOPMENT

Our primary purpose is to foster ideals of friendship, promote educational and cultural interests, create a true sense of social responsibility, and develop the finest qualities of character.
Through our membership, we have all made close and lasting friendships, gained a widespread support system, and found a second home. DG offers a study buddy, a friend with whom to go on any adventure, and a confidant. As DGs, we applaud each other's successes, and help each other through individual struggles. Our chapter is made up of women of diverse individual talents, goals, and achievements brought together by a commitment to unwavering and unconditional friendship
The Delta Gamma Foundation fosters lifetime enrichment for members, promotes Service for Sight, and partners with the Fraternity to ensure the future of our sisterhood.
Service for Sight has been at the heart of Delta Gamma’s philanthropic mission since 1936. The Delta Gamma Foundation has given over $2,800,000 in Service for Sight grants to organizations and schools that share the Foundation’s mission: to promote sight preservation and assistance to children and adults who are blind or visually impaired.
Service for Sight supports the four schools founded by Delta Gammas for the visually impaired and other North American organizations that promote sight preservation and provide assistance to children and adults who are blind or visually impaired. This philanthropy has been at the heart of the Delta Gamma mission since 1936 when a member who was blind, Ruth Billow, Eta-Akron, petitioned members to adopt ""Aid to the Blind"" as our official philanthropy.

Of course, you will make lifelong friends here – and in the future after college. But it’s here you will have the opportunity for individual growth through academic excellence, leadership development, social enrichment and philanthropic involvement that will take you wherever you want to go with your life. 

We believe that the result of contribution to community, developing moral and ethical integrity in all aspects of life, and striving for excellence in all levels of your endeavors are elements that one learns as a part of sorority life. Being part of a social organization is also an important ""fun"" aspect of college life. 

Becoming self-reliant, looking inward toward sisterhood for support and celebrating your individualism are benefits not found in many other organizations.

Every member is selected to life membership. This choice of membership does not relate simply to one college campus or community, for every member belongs to the International Sorority and enjoys a member’s rights, privileges and responsibilities wherever she may live, study, work or travel. As a member, you have the opportunity to be a part of a sisterhood that has blossomed from Four Founders to over 140,000 members with 114 collegiate chapters and 156 alumnae chapters.

The California chapter was founded 1905, having the distinction of being one of the oldest operating chapters in the National organization.
However, ""an organization is not necessarily good because it is old, but old because it is good."" There are a lot of great fraternities out there, and only you can decide which one is right for you. Here are a few reasons why Acacia Fraternity should be on your short list.
Acacia Emphasizes Academic Achievement
Academic achievement should be the first and foremost priority of all university students. It is also central to the mission of Acacia Fraternity, whose chapters stress academics above all else. Moreover, the Acacia Fraternity Foundation assists deserving Acacians with cash scholarships — over $250,000 in scholarships and educational grants were awarded by the foundation during the 2007-2008 academic year alone.
Acacia Develops Leaders
Acacia Fraternity is dedicated to building leaders by providing a wealth of leadership opportunities for our members. From social issues to academic, business to philanthropy, the Acacians of today are the leaders of tomorrow. Click here to view a list of prominent Acacians.
Acacians Help Better the Communities in Which We Reside
Our motto is ""Human Service,"" and we take it very seriously. As member of Acacia Fraternity you will have ongoing opportunities, through structured community service programs, to make a difference in the lives of those in need.
Acacians Value Fitness
Members of Acacia are encouraged to participate in intramural sports, a system in which athletes of all caliber find camaraderie and physical challenge. Whatever the sport, and whatever your skill level, as a member of Acacia you will always have a place on the team.
Acacians Know How to Have Fun
Forget the ""Animal House"" stereotype of reckless partying and irresponsible behavior. Acacia's policy is that each chapter maintains a fun yet responsible social policy that promotes responsible choices and the dignity of every individual as well as zero tolerance for illegal activities.

Divine Delta Chapter | University of California, Berkeley | Est. April 6, 1991
In the Spring of 1991 three strong, brave, and intelligent Latina women, Jennifer Garcia, Maria Martinez, and Rosalinda Valdez felt the need to establish an organization that supplemented their needs as women in higher education at UC Berkeley. This need led to the formation of the Delta chapter of Lambda Theta Nu Sorority, Inc., and the establishment of the first Latina organization at UC Berkeley. Twenty-seven years later, the Delta chapter continues it's commitment to academic excellence, community service, and sisterhood. Although we are a Latina-based sorority, we accept applicants regardless of race or color, national origin, religion, sexual orientation or handicap.
Pillars 
Academic Excellence, Community Service, Sisterhood 
Traditions
Stepping: In 1987 the sisters of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc. first introduced stepping to ladies of Lambda Theta Nu sorority Inc. by inviting them to step on stage in a unity step. Our sisters at California State University, Chico added the use of machetes as a symbol of strength, a symbol with direct cultural ties.
Machetes: In 1989 Lambda Theta Nu Sorority, Inc. became the first sorority to incorporate the use of machetes in a stepping performance. The use of machetes has traditionally showcased the bravery of men. However, for Lambdas, breaking down this male-based tradition not only served as symbol of empowerment but also exemplified the determination of Latinas to integrate into every aspect of life that was not traditionally meant for Latinas. The incorporation of machetes in our performances personify our culture and our strength as women whose perseverance is multidimensional.
Strolling: Strolling, also known as party walking, is a synchronized dance used to encourage commonalities among sisters and showcase our organization and/or to compete in shows.

On December 1, 1975, Lambda Theta Phi was founded on the campus of Kean College in Union, New Jersey.

The ideals of this brotherhood are the following: Academic Excellence; Brotherhood; Leadership; Latino Unity; Service. On a daily basis, our brothers live up to these ideals, as set forth by fourteen young Latino men decades ago. 

Since our founding, Lambda Theta Phi has established chapters in every region of the country at both the undergraduate and professional levels. Our brotherhood continues to provide the necessary skills and resources for the advancement and empowerment of our people and for the betterment of this nation. 

The University of California, Berkeley was home to the newest chapter of Lambda Theta Phi, Latin Fraternity, Inc. in the Spring semester of 2004. Ten undergraduate students came together with the idea of introducing a positive image of a Latino fraternity to the UC Berkeley campus. They wanted to embrace and take part in the unity, brotherhood, pride and respect for all cultures that Lambda Theta Phi offered.

On May 9, 2004, Luis Sanchez, Renato Manay, Renzo Manay, Arquimides Pacheco, and Rafael Hernandez created a historical landmark and established the first Latino Greek Letter Fraternity officially recognized by the National Interfraternal Council (NIC) on the UC Berkeley campus.

Now, since its establishment and through its further development and growth, Lambda Theta Phi in UC Berkeley has continued to carry through its ideals of a service/social fraternity by giving back to the community while engaging in social activities that would allow further bondages among our members and with other organizations. Such include our participation in the Annual AIDS Walk, our service in low-income Oakland Elementary schools, and advocacy of immigrant rights to day laborers within the county of Alameda. Apart from these community service events, this chapter has sought to create strong ties and mutual respect with other Latin and non-Latin organizations through social activities and collaborative efforts.

Lastly, the main goal of Lambda Theta Phi in UC Berkeley is to pursue the educational success of our fraternity brothers. At the national level, from New Jersey to California, many go on to become doctors, lawyers, engineers, among other professionals.

They brought forth this beautiful organization in order to uplift women of color at Cal through sisterhood, mutual support, & love. We hope that bringing Phi Lambda Rho to Berkeley will create a supportive sanctuary within this historically white-serving institution for the growing number of Latinas on campus to flourish.
Phi Lambda Rho Sorority Inc., is a multi-cultural Chicana/Latina sorority popularly known as “Rhosas” or “Rhos.” Sisters of Phi Lambda Rho organize and execute events catered to their four pillars -- Academics, Cultura, Philanthropy, and Sisterhood --throughout the year, making them an active and professional sorority in the community.

The sorority serves as a retention group for aspiring young women in college who wish to leave a positive impact in their communities by engaging in service to the community while displaying a sense of cultural pride and fostering life-long bonds.

ATO was founded at the Virginia Military Institute by three cadets who sought to create a brotherhood based on eternal and immutable principles to unite men and heal the divisions caused by the war. 
ATO continues to reinforce these principles today, as embodied in the fraternity's creed:
""To bind men together in a brotherhood based upon eternal and immutable principles, with a bond as strong as right itself and as lasting as humanity; to know no North, no South, no East, no West, but to know man as man, to teach that true men the world over should stand together and contend for supremacy of good over evil; to teach, not politics, but morals; to foster, not partisanship, but the recognition of true merit wherever found; to have no narrower limits within which to work together for the elevation of man than the outlines of the world: these were the thoughts and hopes uppermost in the minds of the founders of the Alpha Tau Omega Fraternity.""
The Gamma Iota Chapter of Alpha Tau Omega at UC Berkeley has received several awards ranging from academic to athletic successes. We provide an excellent way to delve into a rich life at Berkeley with socials with sororities, brotherhood retreats, philanthropy events, club nights, sporting nights, and a whole lot more. We have consistently successful intramural teams in basketball, football, soccer, softball, and volleyball.
We live in the largest fraternity house on campus, which has been recently renovated and is well taken care of. Our brothers are diverse in their backgrounds and their studies - we are open to all who are charismatic and outgoing.
Our alumni range in successes from former US Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens, the Vice President of Fox Sports, a major Hollywood talent agent, a world class anesthesiologist, a senior partner at Goldman Sachs (who was named by Haas as the Business Leader of the Year for 2014), and a former California superior court judge. 
One of ATO's most notable contributions to Cal is the original Oski. Oski was a bear cub who lived in the ATO house in 1923 until he grew too large and was moved to the Oakland Zoo.

This Alpha (chapter) of Chi Psi at the University of California, Berkeley was founded in 1895, making it one of the oldest and richest traditions on campus. Our Fraternity is composed of undergraduate students from across a wide range of disciplines and backgrounds, brought together by a mutual desire and respect for brotherhood. We support and inspire one another to succeed, despite the competitive academic atmosphere at Berkeley. We maintain a prominent building (The Lodge) on Piedmont Ave, a robust social calendar, intense involvement in campus life, and a dynamic alumni base right here in the Bay Area that provides career support and guidance.
Most importantly, Chi Psi is a brotherhood of gentlemen in the pursuit of excellence. Since our inception more than 175 years ago, the only requirement for membership has always been that one displays the characteristics of a gentleman. By committing ourselves to the values associated with this pursuit, we help young men mature into responsible, compassionate, and confident members of the greater community. 
Furthermore, we are committed to maintaining a diverse, equitable, and inclusive brotherhood that welcomes all kinds of gentleman. We respect and acknowledge our brothers' diverse experiences, and are strong in our unity.

The Fraternity teaches men that these areas of commitment, outlined in The Bond of Phi Delta Theta, are not to be viewed as separate ideals, but as areas of discipline for daily life. Developments intellectually, in leadership, and human service (to name a few) are vital to the men of Phi Delta Theta.

This year, Alternative Breaks offers seven trips to different locations during the spring break, covering issues such as environmental justice, health care, immigration, and housing insecurity.
These student-led trips travel to different locations in California and Puerto Rico to further their understanding of the community and to bring knowledge gained on-site back to the Berkeley community. Students not only participate in a week-long service trip, but also a spring DeCal course to explore various topics revolving around each social justice issue and engage in reflection both pre- and post-trip.

IFC serves chiefly as the official connection between the individual chapters and the University of California. As a council we are by and large self-governed through the efforts of representative delegates from each chapter, who work year long with the officers on IFC to strategize, plan, organize and execute short and long term goals to ensure the growth of the fraternity system at Cal.
IFC can also be thought of as the organization capable of doing things for the benefit of the entire community that no individual chapter has the resources to do on their own. We frequently engage in activities that include Greek-wide philanthropy and social events, public relations with the University and rest of the Berkeley community, risk management and safety of the entire community and Greek wide recruitment, to name a few.
Recruitment into IFC chapters is generally available at the beginning of every semester to every undergraduate male seeking to enhance their time at Cal by being a part of an organization that is truly greater than the sum of its parts. Greek members graduate with uncomparable experiences of the brotherhood, leadership opportunities and social life that is inherent in every chapter, regardless of the letters.

We stand to create an atypical platform for performances, allowing for students to create more devised or individual pieces, politically-charged or focused performances, and non-traditional classic theatre productions. From breaking gender roles in casting, to pushing away racial stereotypes, to even developing minority-based perspectives, A.N.T.I. strives to promote what a theatre company for actionable social change to the existing problems within the theatre industry can look like. While our goal for supporting inclusivity is related to many departments and clubs on campus, A.N.T.I. is different because our primary goal is to be inclusive and to create a theatre company on campus that specifically and primarily focuses on promoting the recognition of an individual's artistry, whether it be identity-based, politically-focused, or just artistic expression.

The group was thus named Alpha, meaning first, and Omega, meaning last, using Chi as a link. The purpose of Alpha Chi Omega was to provide the advancement of the intellectual, social, and moral culture of its members. The Berkeley AXO Pi Chapter was founded on May 7, 1909.

  Alpha Delta Pi was founded by Eugenia Tucker in 1851 at the Wesleyan Female College in Macon Georgia. It holds the distinction of being the first secret society for women, and therefore the foundation of the entire sorority system, hence our motto- First, Finest, Forever.
  Psi Chapter of ADPi was founded in Berkeley in 1913- the 23rd national chapter to be established. In 1931, the chapter purchased our current home, 2400 Piedmont Ave. The house was formerly the summer home of notable Bay Area heiress Phoebe Hearst, and was recognized immediately as the showplace of the campus.
Since then, the mansion has had several modern conveniences added on, but it still retains its original character. It serves as a charming home to almost sixty girls.
  With its location on Channing circle, Psi chapter of Alpha Delta Pi lies at the very heart of the present-day Greek community.

Tri Delta’s Purpose keeps those values alive with our members today.
LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT
Whether serving as officers or participating in a chapter’s educational programming, our members are offered the support and opportunity to grow as leaders. There are four areas of growth that Tri Delta’s leadership education focuses on: organizational growth, intrapersonal growth, interpersonal growth and professional growth. Throughout the collegiate experience, Tri Delta’s members will attain core competencies and skill development in each of these areas.
SCHOLARSHIP
Tri Delta understands that its members are college women first, and part of Tri Delta’s Purpose is to broaden the moral and intellectual lives of members. Whether by providing scholarship funds through the Foundation to assist with educational costs, or by promoting academic success through a chapter’s Academic Excellence Initiative, Tri Delta offers encouragement and support to collegiate members as they pursue academic achievement.
PHILANTHROPY
Members of Tri Delta have a long history of supporting children’s cancer charities at the local level with local children’s hospitals and at the national level with our philanthropic partner, St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital. The Fraternity and its chapters also consistently provide opportunities to raise funds to support the Tri Delta Foundation. This emphasis on philanthropy and service allows our members to develop qualities of unselfish leadership and assume the highest responsibilities of college women.
MEMBER DEVELOPMENT
As part of the collegiate chapter experience, Tri Delta members will participate in multi-dimensional – “3D” – educational and leadership programs designed to inspire them to Live, Learn and Lead in accordance with Tri Delta’s Purpose. Over the course of the collegiate experience, Tri Deltas enjoy a host of opportunities for personal growth and development while building lifelong friendships.

Our primary purpose is to foster ideals of friendship, promote educational and cultural interests, create a true sense of social responsibility, and develop the finest qualities of character.
Through our membership, we have all made close and lasting friendships, gained a widespread support system, and found a second home. DG offers a study buddy, a friend with whom to go on any adventure, and a confidant. As DGs, we applaud each other's successes, and help each other through individual struggles. Our chapter is made up of women of diverse individual talents, goals, and achievements brought together by a commitment to unwavering and unconditional friendship
The Delta Gamma Foundation fosters lifetime enrichment for members, promotes Service for Sight, and partners with the Fraternity to ensure the future of our sisterhood.
Service for Sight has been at the heart of Delta Gamma’s philanthropic mission since 1936. The Delta Gamma Foundation has given over $2,800,000 in Service for Sight grants to organizations and schools that share the Foundation’s mission: to promote sight preservation and assistance to children and adults who are blind or visually impaired.
Service for Sight supports the four schools founded by Delta Gammas for the visually impaired and other North American organizations that promote sight preservation and provide assistance to children and adults who are blind or visually impaired. This philanthropy has been at the heart of the Delta Gamma mission since 1936 when a member who was blind, Ruth Billow, Eta-Akron, petitioned members to adopt ""Aid to the Blind"" as our official philanthropy.

Of course, you will make lifelong friends here – and in the future after college. But it’s here you will have the opportunity for individual growth through academic excellence, leadership development, social enrichment and philanthropic involvement that will take you wherever you want to go with your life. 

We believe that the result of contribution to community, developing moral and ethical integrity in all aspects of life, and striving for excellence in all levels of your endeavors are elements that one learns as a part of sorority life. Being part of a social organization is also an important ""fun"" aspect of college life. 

Becoming self-reliant, looking inward toward sisterhood for support and celebrating your individualism are benefits not found in many other organizations.

Every member is selected to life membership. This choice of membership does not relate simply to one college campus or community, for every member belongs to the International Sorority and enjoys a member’s rights, privileges and responsibilities wherever she may live, study, work or travel. As a member, you have the opportunity to be a part of a sisterhood that has blossomed from Four Founders to over 140,000 members with 114 collegiate chapters and 156 alumnae chapters.

The California chapter was founded 1905, having the distinction of being one of the oldest operating chapters in the National organization.
However, ""an organization is not necessarily good because it is old, but old because it is good."" There are a lot of great fraternities out there, and only you can decide which one is right for you. Here are a few reasons why Acacia Fraternity should be on your short list.
Acacia Emphasizes Academic Achievement
Academic achievement should be the first and foremost priority of all university students. It is also central to the mission of Acacia Fraternity, whose chapters stress academics above all else. Moreover, the Acacia Fraternity Foundation assists deserving Acacians with cash scholarships — over $250,000 in scholarships and educational grants were awarded by the foundation during the 2007-2008 academic year alone.
Acacia Develops Leaders
Acacia Fraternity is dedicated to building leaders by providing a wealth of leadership opportunities for our members. From social issues to academic, business to philanthropy, the Acacians of today are the leaders of tomorrow. Click here to view a list of prominent Acacians.
Acacians Help Better the Communities in Which We Reside
Our motto is ""Human Service,"" and we take it very seriously. As member of Acacia Fraternity you will have ongoing opportunities, through structured community service programs, to make a difference in the lives of those in need.
Acacians Value Fitness
Members of Acacia are encouraged to participate in intramural sports, a system in which athletes of all caliber find camaraderie and physical challenge. Whatever the sport, and whatever your skill level, as a member of Acacia you will always have a place on the team.
Acacians Know How to Have Fun
Forget the ""Animal House"" stereotype of reckless partying and irresponsible behavior. Acacia's policy is that each chapter maintains a fun yet responsible social policy that promotes responsible choices and the dignity of every individual as well as zero tolerance for illegal activities.

All brothers of this fraternity strongly abide by these values in their everyday lives and demonstrate this strength through performing a number of community building activities. Community service is perhaps one of our largest emphases, as we strive to return a small portion of what our families and upbringings have provided to us in our quest for success. The strong bond that we possess among our 23 chapters statewide makes the brotherhood experience unlike any other Greek organization on campus.

Established in 1986, Lambda Theta Nu Sorority, Inc. continues to provide its members with a support system based on academic excellence, community service, and sisterhood. 
The purpose of Lambda Theta Nu Sorority, Inc. is to open the doors of opportunity to the Latinas of our community. Our primary focus is academic excellence and meeting the needs of Latina women in higher education. Lambda Theta Nu Sorority, Inc. also promotes the advancement of Latinas through various campus activities and community services, and provides an environment for personal growth within a unit of sisterhood. Lambda Theta Nu Sorority, Inc.'s priorities, however, will be placed upon academic excellence and community service.
Divine Delta Chapter | University of California, Berkeley | Est. April 6, 1991
In the Spring of 1991 three strong, brave, and intelligent Latina women, Jennifer Garcia, Maria Martinez, and Rosalinda Valdez felt the need to establish an organization that supplemented their needs as women in higher education at UC Berkeley. This need led to the formation of the Delta chapter of Lambda Theta Nu Sorority, Inc., and the establishment of the first Latina organization at UC Berkeley. Twenty-seven years later, the Delta chapter continues it's commitment to academic excellence, community service, and sisterhood. Although we are a Latina-based sorority, we accept applicants regardless of race or color, national origin, religion, sexual orientation or handicap.
Pillars 
Academic Excellence, Community Service, Sisterhood 
Traditions
Stepping: In 1987 the sisters of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc. first introduced stepping to ladies of Lambda Theta Nu sorority Inc. by inviting them to step on stage in a unity step. Our sisters at California State University, Chico added the use of machetes as a symbol of strength, a symbol with direct cultural ties.
Machetes: In 1989 Lambda Theta Nu Sorority, Inc. became the first sorority to incorporate the use of machetes in a stepping performance. The use of machetes has traditionally showcased the bravery of men. However, for Lambdas, breaking down this male-based tradition not only served as symbol of empowerment but also exemplified the determination of Latinas to integrate into every aspect of life that was not traditionally meant for Latinas. The incorporation of machetes in our performances personify our culture and our strength as women whose perseverance is multidimensional.
Strolling: Strolling, also known as party walking, is a synchronized dance used to encourage commonalities among sisters and showcase our organization and/or to compete in shows.

On December 1, 1975, Lambda Theta Phi was founded on the campus of Kean College in Union, New Jersey.

The ideals of this brotherhood are the following: Academic Excellence; Brotherhood; Leadership; Latino Unity; Service. On a daily basis, our brothers live up to these ideals, as set forth by fourteen young Latino men decades ago. 

Since our founding, Lambda Theta Phi has established chapters in every region of the country at both the undergraduate and professional levels. Our brotherhood continues to provide the necessary skills and resources for the advancement and empowerment of our people and for the betterment of this nation. 

The University of California, Berkeley was home to the newest chapter of Lambda Theta Phi, Latin Fraternity, Inc. in the Spring semester of 2004. Ten undergraduate students came together with the idea of introducing a positive image of a Latino fraternity to the UC Berkeley campus. They wanted to embrace and take part in the unity, brotherhood, pride and respect for all cultures that Lambda Theta Phi offered.

On May 9, 2004, Luis Sanchez, Renato Manay, Renzo Manay, Arquimides Pacheco, and Rafael Hernandez created a historical landmark and established the first Latino Greek Letter Fraternity officially recognized by the National Interfraternal Council (NIC) on the UC Berkeley campus.

Now, since its establishment and through its further development and growth, Lambda Theta Phi in UC Berkeley has continued to carry through its ideals of a service/social fraternity by giving back to the community while engaging in social activities that would allow further bondages among our members and with other organizations. Such include our participation in the Annual AIDS Walk, our service in low-income Oakland Elementary schools, and advocacy of immigrant rights to day laborers within the county of Alameda. Apart from these community service events, this chapter has sought to create strong ties and mutual respect with other Latin and non-Latin organizations through social activities and collaborative efforts.

Lastly, the main goal of Lambda Theta Phi in UC Berkeley is to pursue the educational success of our fraternity brothers. At the national level, from New Jersey to California, many go on to become doctors, lawyers, engineers, among other professionals.

Phi Lambda Rho Sorority Inc., is a multi-cultural Chicana/Latina sorority popularly known as “Rhosas” or “Rhos.” Sisters of Phi Lambda Rho organize and execute events catered to their four pillars -- Academics, Cultura, Philanthropy, and Sisterhood --throughout the year, making them an active and professional sorority in the community.

The sorority serves as a retention group for aspiring young women in college who wish to leave a positive impact in their communities by engaging in service to the community while displaying a sense of cultural pride and fostering life-long bonds.

ATO was founded at the Virginia Military Institute by three cadets who sought to create a brotherhood based on eternal and immutable principles to unite men and heal the divisions caused by the war. 
ATO continues to reinforce these principles today, as embodied in the fraternity's creed:
""To bind men together in a brotherhood based upon eternal and immutable principles, with a bond as strong as right itself and as lasting as humanity; to know no North, no South, no East, no West, but to know man as man, to teach that true men the world over should stand together and contend for supremacy of good over evil; to teach, not politics, but morals; to foster, not partisanship, but the recognition of true merit wherever found; to have no narrower limits within which to work together for the elevation of man than the outlines of the world: these were the thoughts and hopes uppermost in the minds of the founders of the Alpha Tau Omega Fraternity.""
The Gamma Iota Chapter of Alpha Tau Omega at UC Berkeley has received several awards ranging from academic to athletic successes. We provide an excellent way to delve into a rich life at Berkeley with socials with sororities, brotherhood retreats, philanthropy events, club nights, sporting nights, and a whole lot more. We have consistently successful intramural teams in basketball, football, soccer, softball, and volleyball.
We live in the largest fraternity house on campus, which has been recently renovated and is well taken care of. Our brothers are diverse in their backgrounds and their studies - we are open to all who are charismatic and outgoing.
Our alumni range in successes from former US Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens, the Vice President of Fox Sports, a major Hollywood talent agent, a world class anesthesiologist, a senior partner at Goldman Sachs (who was named by Haas as the Business Leader of the Year for 2014), and a former California superior court judge. 
One of ATO's most notable contributions to Cal is the original Oski. Oski was a bear cub who lived in the ATO house in 1923 until he grew too large and was moved to the Oakland Zoo.

We support and inspire one another to succeed, despite the competitive academic atmosphere at Berkeley. We maintain a prominent building (The Lodge) on Piedmont Ave, a robust social calendar, intense involvement in campus life, and a dynamic alumni base right here in the Bay Area that provides career support and guidance.
Most importantly, Chi Psi is a brotherhood of gentlemen in the pursuit of excellence. Since our inception more than 175 years ago, the only requirement for membership has always been that one displays the characteristics of a gentleman. By committing ourselves to the values associated with this pursuit, we help young men mature into responsible, compassionate, and confident members of the greater community. 
Furthermore, we are committed to maintaining a diverse, equitable, and inclusive brotherhood that welcomes all kinds of gentleman. We respect and acknowledge our brothers' diverse experiences, and are strong in our unity.

These student-led trips travel to different locations in California and Puerto Rico to further their understanding of the community and to bring knowledge gained on-site back to the Berkeley community. Students not only participate in a week-long service trip, but also a spring DeCal course to explore various topics revolving around each social justice issue and engage in reflection both pre- and post-trip.

We frequently engage in activities that include Greek-wide philanthropy and social events, public relations with the University and rest of the Berkeley community, risk management and safety of the entire community and Greek wide recruitment, to name a few.
Recruitment into IFC chapters is generally available at the beginning of every semester to every undergraduate male seeking to enhance their time at Cal by being a part of an organization that is truly greater than the sum of its parts. Greek members graduate with uncomparable experiences of the brotherhood, leadership opportunities and social life that is inherent in every chapter, regardless of the letters.

The Anthropomorphic Animal Appreciation Association hopes to serve and portray the furry population on campus positively, as well as foster community collaboration between furries at Berkeley with other interest-based or academic groups.

  Alpha Delta Pi was founded by Eugenia Tucker in 1851 at the Wesleyan Female College in Macon Georgia. It holds the distinction of being the first secret society for women, and therefore the foundation of the entire sorority system, hence our motto- First, Finest, Forever.
  Psi Chapter of ADPi was founded in Berkeley in 1913- the 23rd national chapter to be established. In 1931, the chapter purchased our current home, 2400 Piedmont Ave. The house was formerly the summer home of notable Bay Area heiress Phoebe Hearst, and was recognized immediately as the showplace of the campus.
Since then, the mansion has had several modern conveniences added on, but it still retains its original character. It serves as a charming home to almost sixty girls.
  With its location on Channing circle, Psi chapter of Alpha Delta Pi lies at the very heart of the present-day Greek community.

There are four areas of growth that Tri Delta’s leadership education focuses on: organizational growth, intrapersonal growth, interpersonal growth and professional growth. Throughout the collegiate experience, Tri Delta’s members will attain core competencies and skill development in each of these areas.
SCHOLARSHIP
Tri Delta understands that its members are college women first, and part of Tri Delta’s Purpose is to broaden the moral and intellectual lives of members. Whether by providing scholarship funds through the Foundation to assist with educational costs, or by promoting academic success through a chapter’s Academic Excellence Initiative, Tri Delta offers encouragement and support to collegiate members as they pursue academic achievement.
PHILANTHROPY
Members of Tri Delta have a long history of supporting children’s cancer charities at the local level with local children’s hospitals and at the national level with our philanthropic partner, St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital. The Fraternity and its chapters also consistently provide opportunities to raise funds to support the Tri Delta Foundation. This emphasis on philanthropy and service allows our members to develop qualities of unselfish leadership and assume the highest responsibilities of college women.
MEMBER DEVELOPMENT
As part of the collegiate chapter experience, Tri Delta members will participate in multi-dimensional – “3D” – educational and leadership programs designed to inspire them to Live, Learn and Lead in accordance with Tri Delta’s Purpose. Over the course of the collegiate experience, Tri Deltas enjoy a host of opportunities for personal growth and development while building lifelong friendships.

This philanthropy has been at the heart of the Delta Gamma mission since 1936 when a member who was blind, Ruth Billow, Eta-Akron, petitioned members to adopt ""Aid to the Blind"" as our official philanthropy.

We believe that the result of contribution to community, developing moral and ethical integrity in all aspects of life, and striving for excellence in all levels of your endeavors are elements that one learns as a part of sorority life.

Becoming self-reliant, looking inward toward sisterhood for support and celebrating your individualism are benefits not found in many other organizations.

Every member is selected to life membership. This choice of membership does not relate simply to one college campus or community, for every member belongs to the International Sorority and enjoys a member’s rights, privileges and responsibilities wherever she may live, study, work or travel. As a member, you have the opportunity to be a part of a sisterhood that has blossomed from Four Founders to over 140,000 members with 114 collegiate chapters and 156 alumnae chapters.

These mentors establish close bonds with the children as they interact one-on-one and serve as a voice for the children during the judicial process.
The Omega chapter of Kappa AlphaTheta supports CASA in a number of ways including donations from our annual philanthropic fundraising events, Theta Dodgeball and Cafe Casa (our famous Theta Brunch held at our beautiful Theta home, open to the Berkeley community).

The California chapter was founded 1905, having the distinction of being one of the oldest operating chapters in the National organization.
However, ""an organization is not necessarily good because it is old, but old because it is good."" There are a lot of great fraternities out there, and only you can decide which one is right for you. Here are a few reasons why Acacia Fraternity should be on your short list.
Acacia Emphasizes Academic Achievement
Academic achievement should be the first and foremost priority of all university students. It is also central to the mission of Acacia Fraternity, whose chapters stress academics above all else. Moreover, the Acacia Fraternity Foundation assists deserving Acacians with cash scholarships — over $250,000 in scholarships and educational grants were awarded by the foundation during the 2007-2008 academic year alone.
Acacia Develops Leaders
Acacia Fraternity is dedicated to building leaders by providing a wealth of leadership opportunities for our members. From social issues to academic, business to philanthropy, the Acacians of today are the leaders of tomorrow. Click here to view a list of prominent Acacians.
Acacians Help Better the Communities in Which We Reside
Our motto is ""Human Service,"" and we take it very seriously. As member of Acacia Fraternity you will have ongoing opportunities, through structured community service programs, to make a difference in the lives of those in need.
Acacians Value Fitness
Members of Acacia are encouraged to participate in intramural sports, a system in which athletes of all caliber find camaraderie and physical challenge. Whatever the sport, and whatever your skill level, as a member of Acacia you will always have a place on the team.
Acacians Know How to Have Fun
Forget the ""Animal House"" stereotype of reckless partying and irresponsible behavior. Acacia's policy is that each chapter maintains a fun yet responsible social policy that promotes responsible choices and the dignity of every individual as well as zero tolerance for illegal activities.

Established in 1986, Lambda Theta Nu Sorority, Inc. continues to provide its members with a support system based on academic excellence, community service, and sisterhood. 
The purpose of Lambda Theta Nu Sorority, Inc. is to open the doors of opportunity to the Latinas of our community. Our primary focus is academic excellence and meeting the needs of Latina women in higher education. Lambda Theta Nu Sorority, Inc. also promotes the advancement of Latinas through various campus activities and community services, and provides an environment for personal growth within a unit of sisterhood. Lambda Theta Nu Sorority, Inc.'s priorities, however, will be placed upon academic excellence and community service.
Divine Delta Chapter | University of California, Berkeley | Est. April 6, 1991
In the Spring of 1991 three strong, brave, and intelligent Latina women, Jennifer Garcia, Maria Martinez, and Rosalinda Valdez felt the need to establish an organization that supplemented their needs as women in higher education at UC Berkeley. This need led to the formation of the Delta chapter of Lambda Theta Nu Sorority, Inc., and the establishment of the first Latina organization at UC Berkeley. Twenty-seven years later, the Delta chapter continues it's commitment to academic excellence, community service, and sisterhood. Although we are a Latina-based sorority, we accept applicants regardless of race or color, national origin, religion, sexual orientation or handicap.
Pillars 
Academic Excellence, Community Service, Sisterhood 
Traditions
Stepping: In 1987 the sisters of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc. first introduced stepping to ladies of Lambda Theta Nu sorority Inc. by inviting them to step on stage in a unity step. Our sisters at California State University, Chico added the use of machetes as a symbol of strength, a symbol with direct cultural ties.
Machetes: In 1989 Lambda Theta Nu Sorority, Inc. became the first sorority to incorporate the use of machetes in a stepping performance. The use of machetes has traditionally showcased the bravery of men. However, for Lambdas, breaking down this male-based tradition not only served as symbol of empowerment but also exemplified the determination of Latinas to integrate into every aspect of life that was not traditionally meant for Latinas. The incorporation of machetes in our performances personify our culture and our strength as women whose perseverance is multidimensional.
Strolling: Strolling, also known as party walking, is a synchronized dance used to encourage commonalities among sisters and showcase our organization and/or to compete in shows.

On December 1, 1975, Lambda Theta Phi was founded on the campus of Kean College in Union, New Jersey.

The ideals of this brotherhood are the following: Academic Excellence; Brotherhood; Leadership; Latino Unity; Service. On a daily basis, our brothers live up to these ideals, as set forth by fourteen young Latino men decades ago. 

Since our founding, Lambda Theta Phi has established chapters in every region of the country at both the undergraduate and professional levels. Our brotherhood continues to provide the necessary skills and resources for the advancement and empowerment of our people and for the betterment of this nation. 

The University of California, Berkeley was home to the newest chapter of Lambda Theta Phi, Latin Fraternity, Inc. in the Spring semester of 2004. Ten undergraduate students came together with the idea of introducing a positive image of a Latino fraternity to the UC Berkeley campus. They wanted to embrace and take part in the unity, brotherhood, pride and respect for all cultures that Lambda Theta Phi offered.

On May 9, 2004, Luis Sanchez, Renato Manay, Renzo Manay, Arquimides Pacheco, and Rafael Hernandez created a historical landmark and established the first Latino Greek Letter Fraternity officially recognized by the National Interfraternal Council (NIC) on the UC Berkeley campus.

Now, since its establishment and through its further development and growth, Lambda Theta Phi in UC Berkeley has continued to carry through its ideals of a service/social fraternity by giving back to the community while engaging in social activities that would allow further bondages among our members and with other organizations. Such include our participation in the Annual AIDS Walk, our service in low-income Oakland Elementary schools, and advocacy of immigrant rights to day laborers within the county of Alameda. Apart from these community service events, this chapter has sought to create strong ties and mutual respect with other Latin and non-Latin organizations through social activities and collaborative efforts.

Lastly, the main goal of Lambda Theta Phi in UC Berkeley is to pursue the educational success of our fraternity brothers. At the national level, from New Jersey to California, many go on to become doctors, lawyers, engineers, among other professionals.

ATO was founded at the Virginia Military Institute by three cadets who sought to create a brotherhood based on eternal and immutable principles to unite men and heal the divisions caused by the war. 
ATO continues to reinforce these principles today, as embodied in the fraternity's creed:
""To bind men together in a brotherhood based upon eternal and immutable principles, with a bond as strong as right itself and as lasting as humanity; to know no North, no South, no East, no West, but to know man as man, to teach that true men the world over should stand together and contend for supremacy of good over evil; to teach, not politics, but morals; to foster, not partisanship, but the recognition of true merit wherever found; to have no narrower limits within which to work together for the elevation of man than the outlines of the world: these were the thoughts and hopes uppermost in the minds of the founders of the Alpha Tau Omega Fraternity.""
The Gamma Iota Chapter of Alpha Tau Omega at UC Berkeley has received several awards ranging from academic to athletic successes. We provide an excellent way to delve into a rich life at Berkeley with socials with sororities, brotherhood retreats, philanthropy events, club nights, sporting nights, and a whole lot more. We have consistently successful intramural teams in basketball, football, soccer, softball, and volleyball.
We live in the largest fraternity house on campus, which has been recently renovated and is well taken care of. Our brothers are diverse in their backgrounds and their studies - we are open to all who are charismatic and outgoing.
Our alumni range in successes from former US Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens, the Vice President of Fox Sports, a major Hollywood talent agent, a world class anesthesiologist, a senior partner at Goldman Sachs (who was named by Haas as the Business Leader of the Year for 2014), and a former California superior court judge. 
One of ATO's most notable contributions to Cal is the original Oski. Oski was a bear cub who lived in the ATO house in 1923 until he grew too large and was moved to the Oakland Zoo.

This Alpha (chapter) of Chi Psi at the University of California, Berkeley was founded in 1895, making it one of the oldest and richest traditions on campus. Our Fraternity is composed of undergraduate students from across a wide range of disciplines and backgrounds, brought together by a mutual desire and respect for brotherhood. We support and inspire one another to succeed, despite the competitive academic atmosphere at Berkeley. We maintain a prominent building (The Lodge) on Piedmont Ave, a robust social calendar, intense involvement in campus life, and a dynamic alumni base right here in the Bay Area that provides career support and guidance.
Most importantly, Chi Psi is a brotherhood of gentlemen in the pursuit of excellence. Since our inception more than 175 years ago, the only requirement for membership has always been that one displays the characteristics of a gentleman. By committing ourselves to the values associated with this pursuit, we help young men mature into responsible, compassionate, and confident members of the greater community. 
Furthermore, we are committed to maintaining a diverse, equitable, and inclusive brotherhood that welcomes all kinds of gentleman. We respect and acknowledge our brothers' diverse experiences, and are strong in our unity.

We accomplish this through a variety of educational programming opportunities, including our Leadership Institute, held annually in a different city across the country; the Winter Educational Conference held every January in Indianapolis; the Global Service Initiative, which sends a group of our undergraduate men to Jamaica where they spend a week doing service work; and staff- and volunteer-run Regional Leadership Seminars.

These objectives, referred to as the Cardinal Principles, have guided over 225,000 men since 1848 when the Fraternity was founded at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio.
The Fraternity teaches men that these areas of commitment, outlined in The Bond of Phi Delta Theta, are not to be viewed as separate ideals, but as areas of discipline for daily life. Developments intellectually, in leadership, and human service (to name a few) are vital to the men of Phi Delta Theta. A member will support, and in turn have the support of, his brothers as these principles are lived out.

Many participants return from their experiences with greater insight on a particular social justice issue and a deeper understanding of what it means to get involved in the community. This year, Alternative Breaks offers seven trips to different locations during the spring break, covering issues such as environmental justice, health care, immigration, and housing insecurity.
These student-led trips travel to different locations in California and Puerto Rico to further their understanding of the community and to bring knowledge gained on-site back to the Berkeley community. Students not only participate in a week-long service trip, but also a spring DeCal course to explore various topics revolving around each social justice issue and engage in reflection both pre- and post-trip.
Our Spring 2024 experiences include:
Central Valley - The Unsung Heroes Harvesting Your Tomorrow: Exploitation, Migration and Resilience
San Francisco - Economic Justice | No Place Like Home: Housing Inequity 
East Bay - Environmental & Food Justice: Heal Your Planet Heal Yourself (HYPHY): Building Sustainable Legacies Rooted in the Town

We are the binding organization that ties all of the recognized fraternity chapters on campus. The number of fraternities is now over thrity, which amounts to approximately 1300 of the undergradute men at UC Berkeley. IFC serves chiefly as the official connection between the individual chapters and the University of California. As a council we are by and large self-governed through the efforts of representative delegates from each chapter, who work year long with the officers on IFC to strategize, plan, organize and execute short and long term goals to ensure the growth of the fraternity system at Cal.
IFC can also be thought of as the organization capable of doing things for the benefit of the entire community that no individual chapter has the resources to do on their own. We frequently engage in activities that include Greek-wide philanthropy and social events, public relations with the University and rest of the Berkeley community, risk management and safety of the entire community and Greek wide recruitment, to name a few.
Recruitment into IFC chapters is generally available at the beginning of every semester to every undergraduate male seeking to enhance their time at Cal by being a part of an organization that is truly greater than the sum of its parts. Greek members graduate with uncomparable experiences of the brotherhood, leadership opportunities and social life that is inherent in every chapter, regardless of the letters.

  Bear Closet aims to create a platform for LGBTQ+ students to share their personal narratives with middle and high school students in the Bay Area. We encourage members and supporters of the LGBTQ+ community to serve as mentors and advocates for the equality of all identities by sharing their personal journey toward self-love and acceptance. Through class discussions and projects, we will explore LGBTQ+ experiences and learn more about the community and how we can best serve it. In addition, students will also be provided with public speaking opportunities that will help inspire Bay Area youth to take pride in their identity and fight for a stronger, more inclusive future.
WHAT WE DO
Bear Closet is a community-based organization and DeCal course offered at UC Berkeley dedicated to training and preparing students to speak at middle and high schools regarding LGBTQ life at college, through the Pacific Center’s Speaker’s Bureau program. Such services are essential to motivate LGBTQ adolescents to pursue higher education with the reassurance of a better, more inclusive future they may look forward to in college. Our organization and course are open to students of all genders and sexualities (including straight, cisgender allies), and will facilitate students’ volunteer work with LGBTQ support organizations, including the Pacific Center and Center for Educational Partnerships.

We welcome anyone interested in sharing their queer-related stories and experiences (i.e. personal, of a friend/family member, etc.) at middle and high school classrooms, in hopes of motivating out or closeted youth to pursue college education with the assurance of a better future. Rather than strictly focusing on assignments and deadlines, our two-unit DeCal prioritizes class discussion and bonding among its members, for the sake of establishing a strong base for community service.

The purpose of the group is to promote networking and connection amongst emerging social workers of API backgrounds, as social services catered to the broad API community are so sparse and limited. API Caucus was also formed to create a safe holding space for API folks to build community with each other and reflect about their experiences in and out of the MSW program. API Caucus also serves to empower and uplift the voices of self-identified Asian and/or Pacific Islander students within a program that lacks representation of this community.

  Alpha Delta Pi was founded by Eugenia Tucker in 1851 at the Wesleyan Female College in Macon Georgia. It holds the distinction of being the first secret society for women, and therefore the foundation of the entire sorority system, hence our motto- First, Finest, Forever.
  Psi Chapter of ADPi was founded in Berkeley in 1913- the 23rd national chapter to be established. In 1931, the chapter purchased our current home, 2400 Piedmont Ave. The house was formerly the summer home of notable Bay Area heiress Phoebe Hearst, and was recognized immediately as the showplace of the campus.
Since then, the mansion has had several modern conveniences added on, but it still retains its original character. It serves as a charming home to almost sixty girls.
  With its location on Channing circle, Psi chapter of Alpha Delta Pi lies at the very heart of the present-day Greek community.

Tri Delta’s Purpose keeps those values alive with our members today.
LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT
Whether serving as officers or participating in a chapter’s educational programming, our members are offered the support and opportunity to grow as leaders. There are four areas of growth that Tri Delta’s leadership education focuses on: organizational growth, intrapersonal growth, interpersonal growth and professional growth. Throughout the collegiate experience, Tri Delta’s members will attain core competencies and skill development in each of these areas.
SCHOLARSHIP
Tri Delta understands that its members are college women first, and part of Tri Delta’s Purpose is to broaden the moral and intellectual lives of members. Whether by providing scholarship funds through the Foundation to assist with educational costs, or by promoting academic success through a chapter’s Academic Excellence Initiative, Tri Delta offers encouragement and support to collegiate members as they pursue academic achievement.
PHILANTHROPY
Members of Tri Delta have a long history of supporting children’s cancer charities at the local level with local children’s hospitals and at the national level with our philanthropic partner, St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital. The Fraternity and its chapters also consistently provide opportunities to raise funds to support the Tri Delta Foundation. This emphasis on philanthropy and service allows our members to develop qualities of unselfish leadership and assume the highest responsibilities of college women.
MEMBER DEVELOPMENT
As part of the collegiate chapter experience, Tri Delta members will participate in multi-dimensional – “3D” – educational and leadership programs designed to inspire them to Live, Learn and Lead in accordance with Tri Delta’s Purpose. Over the course of the collegiate experience, Tri Deltas enjoy a host of opportunities for personal growth and development while building lifelong friendships.

Through our membership, we have all made close and lasting friendships, gained a widespread support system, and found a second home. DG offers a study buddy, a friend with whom to go on any adventure, and a confidant. As DGs, we applaud each other's successes, and help each other through individual struggles.

The Delta Gamma Foundation fosters lifetime enrichment for members, promotes Service for Sight, and partners with the Fraternity to ensure the future of our sisterhood.
Service for Sight has been at the heart of Delta Gamma’s philanthropic mission since 1936. The Delta Gamma Foundation has given over $2,800,000 in Service for Sight grants to organizations and schools that share the Foundation’s mission: to promote sight preservation and assistance to children and adults who are blind or visually impaired.
Service for Sight supports the four schools founded by Delta Gammas for the visually impaired and other North American organizations that promote sight preservation and provide assistance to children and adults who are blind or visually impaired. This philanthropy has been at the heart of the Delta Gamma mission since 1936 when a member who was blind, Ruth Billow, Eta-Akron, petitioned members to adopt ""Aid to the Blind"" as our official philanthropy.

Of course, you will make lifelong friends here – and in the future after college. But it’s here you will have the opportunity for individual growth through academic excellence, leadership development, social enrichment and philanthropic involvement that will take you wherever you want to go with your life. 

We believe that the result of contribution to community, developing moral and ethical integrity in all aspects of life, and striving for excellence in all levels of your endeavors are elements that one learns as a part of sorority life. Being part of a social organization is also an important ""fun"" aspect of college life. 

Becoming self-reliant, looking inward toward sisterhood for support and celebrating your individualism are benefits not found in many other organizations.

Every member is selected to life membership. This choice of membership does not relate simply to one college campus or community, for every member belongs to the International Sorority and enjoys a member’s rights, privileges and responsibilities wherever she may live, study, work or travel. As a member, you have the opportunity to be a part of a sisterhood that has blossomed from Four Founders to over 140,000 members with 114 collegiate chapters and 156 alumnae chapters.

The Omega Chapter was founded at University of California, Berkeley in 1890. Our Chapter occupied the first women's chapter house built by Omega sister Julia Morgan, the first woman to study architecture at the Ecole de Beaux Arts in Paris. 
  Kappa Alpha Theta is proud to be national supporters of Court Appointed Special Advocates (CASA). CASA is an organization that provides mentors for abused, abandoned and neglected children. These mentors establish close bonds with the children as they interact one-on-one and serve as a voice for the children during the judicial process.

The phrase was selected as the motto. Manhood, Scholarship, Perseverance and Uplift were adopted as cardinal principles.

The California chapter was founded 1905, having the distinction of being one of the oldest operating chapters in the National organization.
However, ""an organization is not necessarily good because it is old, but old because it is good."" There are a lot of great fraternities out there, and only you can decide which one is right for you. Here are a few reasons why Acacia Fraternity should be on your short list.
Acacia Emphasizes Academic Achievement
Academic achievement should be the first and foremost priority of all university students. It is also central to the mission of Acacia Fraternity, whose chapters stress academics above all else. Moreover, the Acacia Fraternity Foundation assists deserving Acacians with cash scholarships — over $250,000 in scholarships and educational grants were awarded by the foundation during the 2007-2008 academic year alone.
Acacia Develops Leaders
Acacia Fraternity is dedicated to building leaders by providing a wealth of leadership opportunities for our members. From social issues to academic, business to philanthropy, the Acacians of today are the leaders of tomorrow. Click here to view a list of prominent Acacians.
Acacians Help Better the Communities in Which We Reside
Our motto is ""Human Service,"" and we take it very seriously. As member of Acacia Fraternity you will have ongoing opportunities, through structured community service programs, to make a difference in the lives of those in need.
Acacians Value Fitness
Members of Acacia are encouraged to participate in intramural sports, a system in which athletes of all caliber find camaraderie and physical challenge. Whatever the sport, and whatever your skill level, as a member of Acacia you will always have a place on the team.
Acacians Know How to Have Fun
Forget the ""Animal House"" stereotype of reckless partying and irresponsible behavior. Acacia's policy is that each chapter maintains a fun yet responsible social policy that promotes responsible choices and the dignity of every individual as well as zero tolerance for illegal activities.

Everyone in the club loves the sport of airsoft, and we want to share it with as many people as possible!

Regular events primarily consist of 1-day ""open-play""s at local fields, and more events may be organized. Most club events require members to pay the field/event fee (normally around $30 for the day), but larger, more cost-prohibitive events, are often club-funded. Carpools and equipment rentals are organized through the club Discord.
  Discord is our main form of communication. We coordinate events and answer questions on the discord server.

Most club events require members to pay the field/event fee (normally around $30 for the day), but larger, more cost-prohibitive events, are often club-funded.

The team is a member of the American Forensics Association (AFA), the National Forensics Association (NFA), and the National Debate Tournament (NDT).
Members of the team practice an average of four hours each week and compete in an average of four speech and debate tournaments each semester. Travel, lodging, and registration expenses associated with these competitions are subsidized by the team – though students are prioritized for travel on the basis of their prior competitive success.
Students interested in joining the Petticrew Forum should contact the team’s head coach, Jim Schultz, at  Schul214@purdue.edu. In your email, please mention (a) your year and major, (b) your prior experience in competitive speech and debate activities, (c) whether you’re interested in competing in IEs or policy debate, and (d) any other information that you think might be pertinent (e.g., what specific IEs you’d like to compete in, or what your speaking positions are, etc.).
The Petticrew Forum does not accept ‘walk-ons’ throughout the course of the academic year, as this disrupts our practice and competition schedule. Those interested in joining the team are strongly encouraged to contact the team’s coach before the start of the fall semester so that they can be made aware of the team’s policies and expectations.

  Alpha Lambda Delta and Phi Eta Sigma are two of the oldest and most prestigious national honor societies on the Purdue University Campus.  Both honor societies are rich in history and tradition at hundreds of campuses across the nation.  Phi Eta Sigma was founded in 1923 at the University of Illinois as a freshman honor society designed to promote academic achievement among male students.  Alpha Lambda Delta was originally founded as an honor society strictly for women at the University of Illinois in 1924.  A chapter was founded at Purdue University in 1926.  In the mid-1970s, Alpha Lambda Delta and Phi Eta Sigma became co-ed national honor societies.  Each of these societies operates separately at the national level.  However, both Alpha Lambda Delta and Phi Eta Sigma operate as one entity on the Purdue University campus, as well as many other campuses across the nation.  The goals of both honor societies are better served when operating as a single team dedicated to academic excellence and community service.
  Alpha Lambda Delta Phi Eta Sigma promotes hard work and dedication in and out of the classroom.  By encouraging incoming freshmen to earn a 3.5 GPA, the honor society creates a strong foundation for later collegiate success.  In addition to helping young college students develop and realize goals within their academic curriculum, Alpha Lambda Delta Phi Eta Sigma encourages students to recognize achievable goals within the community.  Alpha Lambda Delta Phi Eta Sigma and its members participate in a variety of community service projects each year. 
  The Purdue University chapter is no exception to this national standard.  Officers and volunteers from the campus chapter offer a well-developed tutoring program for children who reside in Purdue Village.  Serving Thanksgiving dinner at the local homeless shelter, ringing bells for the Salvation Army, and participating in the Walk for Life are just a few of the ever-increasing and ever-changing examples of the community service performed by Purdue University members.  The local chapter also sponsors the Boiler Academic Super Bowl where various student organizations have the opportunity to form teams and compete in academic challenges to raise money for the local Lafayette Adult Resource Academy.  Each year, the chapter officers seek new projects for member involvement.  It is the goal of Alpha Lambda Delta Phi Eta Sigma's Purdue officers to participate in at least one service project each month. 
  From its promotion of scholastic achievement to its strong involvement in the local community, Alpha Lambda Delta Phi Eta Sigma at Purdue University demonstrates its dedication to the growth and positive development of its members.  It certainly proves to be an excellent student organization for participation.

         Since its founding on December 4, 1906, Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Inc. has supplied voice and vision to the struggle of African-Americans and people of color around the world. Alpha Phi Alpha, the first intercollegiate Greek-letter fraternity established for African-Americans, was founded at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York by seven college men who recognized the need for a strong bond of Brotherhood among African descendants in this country. The visionary founders, known as the 'Jewels' of the Fraternity, are Henry Arthur Callis, Charles Henry Chapman, Eugene Kinckle Jones, George Biddle Kelley, Nathaniel Allison Murray, Robert Harold Ogle, and Vertner Woodson Tandy.

       The Fraternity initially served as a study and support group for minority students who faced racial prejusdice, both educationally and socially, at Cornell. The Jewel founders and early leaders of the Fraternity succeeded in laying a firm foundation for Alpha Phi Alpha's principles of scholarship, fellowship, moral character, and the uplifting of humanity.
       Gamma Rho Chapter of Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Inc. was established at Purdue University on April 24, 1948 by the following charter members. James C. Butler, Chester L. French, Raymond L. Hall, Milton B. Kendrick, John E. Littman, William N. Lovelace, Jimmie Mosley John E. Rudder, Richard Wallace, Walter H. White and George A. Younger. Since its founding at Purdue University, Gamma Rho Chapter boasts a rich legacy of producing successful men.

      Gamma Rho Chapter has maintained the fraternity's tradition of excellence in manly deeds, scholarship, and great regard of all mankind. As a demonstration of this commitment, the chapter sponsors a myriad of community service events including: Annual Voter's Registration Drive, Study Tables & Tutoring, Big Brothers Big Sisters mentoring, Food & Clothing Drives for the Needy, along with Alpha Phi Alpha's mandated programs.

Alpha Phi Omega. We are Purdue's national gender-inclusive service organization, bringing together college students in developing Leadership, promoting Friendship, and providing Service to humanity since our chapter's founding in 1932.
  Alpha Phi Omega is open to students of any background and focuses on volunteering on campus, in the local community, and with national organizations. We also donate to a number of charities via member-raised donations.
  APO is a service-oriented organization as opposed to social fraternity. For this reason, we do not share a house, but instead have a large co-working office in the Purdue Memorial Union. Make no mistake though, joining APO is like joining a family. With approximately 60 active members in our chapter and 350 active chapters nationwide, you will be a part of a large network of members and alumni. Purdue’s Alpha Gamma chapter in particular has always ranked as one of the top chapters in the national organization and prides itself on being a fun and welcoming organization. 
  We would love to have you in our chapter! Come over to PMU B050E anytime and someone would be happy to tell you more about us. Find out more through our national office at apo.org or our chapter website at purdueapo.org.

         Since its founding on December 4, 1906, Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Inc. has supplied voice and vision to the struggle of African-Americans and people of color around the world. Alpha Phi Alpha, the first intercollegiate Greek-letter fraternity established for African-Americans, was founded at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York by seven college men who recognized the need for a strong bond of Brotherhood among African descendants in this country. The visionary founders, known as the 'Jewels' of the Fraternity, are Henry Arthur Callis, Charles Henry Chapman, Eugene Kinckle Jones, George Biddle Kelley, Nathaniel Allison Murray, Robert Harold Ogle, and Vertner Woodson Tandy.

       The Fraternity initially served as a study and support group for minority students who faced racial prejusdice, both educationally and socially, at Cornell. The Jewel founders and early leaders of the Fraternity succeeded in laying a firm foundation for Alpha Phi Alpha's principles of scholarship, fellowship, moral character, and the uplifting of humanity.
       Gamma Rho Chapter of Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Inc. was established at Purdue University on April 24, 1948 by the following charter members. James C. Butler, Chester L. French, Raymond L. Hall, Milton B. Kendrick, John E. Littman, William N. Lovelace, Jimmie Mosley John E. Rudder, Richard Wallace, Walter H. White and George A. Younger. Since its founding at Purdue University, Gamma Rho Chapter boasts a rich legacy of producing successful men.

      Gamma Rho Chapter has maintained the fraternity's tradition of excellence in manly deeds, scholarship, and great regard of all mankind. As a demonstration of this commitment, the chapter sponsors a myriad of community service events including: Annual Voter's Registration Drive, Study Tables & Tutoring, Big Brothers Big Sisters mentoring, Food & Clothing Drives for the Needy, along with Alpha Phi Alpha's mandated programs.

         Affectionately known as ""Gangsta Gamma Rho,"" the Brothers continue the rich tradition of community uplift and empowerment, as we live true to the Alpha motto: First of All, Servants of All, We Shall Transcend All.

We work with passionate college women who yearn for deeper community on their campus by providing them with the training, tools, resources and encouragement needed to start and lead a Delight chapter. 
Delight is more than just a bible study! Each community meets weekly to share stories of God at work. They also incorporate worship nights, opportunities to serve and fun get-togethers that help foster relationships. We fully believe in doing life together. Delight provides the opportunity for hundreds of women to Delight in the Lord together throughout their college journey. 
The heart of Delight Ministries is to provide an environment for women to vulnerably share about how Christ has been at work in their lives. Our curriculum is made of stories from college women sharing about the ups and downs of their faith journeys. We've heard stories of depression, loneliness, heartbreak, identity crisis and pain, but the common theme throughout them all is that even still, God is good. 
These stories are paired with scripture and discussion questions and are used weekly by all Delight communities. Stories of real women opens the door for authentic conversations and deep-rooted relationships. We truly believe in the power of vulnerability and how it impacts our relationship with Christ and others. 
It's so easy to walk through college and never encounter true community or a relationship with Jesus. Delight Ministries desires to change the college experience for women everywhere by helping them to transform their stories. We believe that transformation happens when we live fully invested in pursuing Christ, vulnerability and community. Our stories become no longer about us, but rather about Christ in us.

We seek to reach out to young women so that they can be welcomed into our family and enjoy the benefits of our organization. Motivated and ambitious, we strive to promote every conviction of Delta Phi Lambda. Thus, we aspire to reach out to female college students to enrich their lives, and by doing so, enriching ours.

Our purpose includes promoting multiculturalism with an emphasis on Asian awareness, reaching out to the community as a whole, and embracing fellow collegiate women into a nurturing environment.

As an Asian-interest sorority, the Sisters understand how difficult it is to be a part of the minority population. By uniting with other cultures, everyone takes part in overcoming adversity. Also, uniting with students with different nationalities provides the Sisters of Delta Phi Lambda an opportunity to learn about other cultures, appreciate our differences, and share our similarities. We will take initiative to assist any minority organization or community that is interested in promoting multiculturalism and bridging the gap between all minority groups.

Not only do we strive for unity in our communities, we also participate in several philanthropic events that concentrate on helping women and children. Serving our community is our passion. We must not forget how fortunate we are to be able to give to the community and we must not forget how to give.
  We hope to expand our Sisterhood on a larger scale to create a support system of sisterhood across the United States. By doing so, Sisters would be able to find other Sisters no matter where their plans may take them. Moreover, having additional chapters nationally will help Sisters better adjust to their new environment should their plans take them to greater things in life.

Finally, we hope to develop well-rounded individuals by both nurturing our natural talents, as well as by helping each other strengthen our weakness. By accomplishing these two tasks, we feel that our members are better prepared to walk into the real world with confidence.

Delta Phi Lambda provides a once in a lifetime experience that exhibits our unique sisterhood, community involvement, preparedness for the real world, and tremendous leadership.

They dreamt of a Sisterhood which would unite all womxn interested in the Latinx culture and in intercultural exchange to empower them to become leaders through personal, academic, and professional fulfillment. Ever since, the Distinguished Ladies of Delta Phi Mu have fulfilled the dreams of our Founding Mothers by flourishing within a bond of true sisterhood which is based on the principles of support, guidance, assistance, and love. Although we come from different backgrounds, together we have formed a united family of sisters who support, guide, assist, and love one another in all that we strive to do.
  Our motto, ""La Esperanza del Futuro Está en las Manos de la Mujer"" or ""The Hope of the Future Lies in the Hands of the Woman"", epitomizes the purpose that lies within our Sisterhood to work tirelessly toward making the world a better place for all womxn. We do so by uplifting our communities through service and advocacy and by motivating all womxn to become leaders through personal, academic, and professional development. 
  Delta Phi Mu Sorority, Inc. is nationally recognized as an official sponsor of The Heart Truth® initiative through the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute.

  Alpha Lambda Delta and Phi Eta Sigma are two of the oldest and most prestigious national honor societies on the Purdue University Campus.  Both honor societies are rich in history and tradition at hundreds of campuses across the nation.  Phi Eta Sigma was founded in 1923 at the University of Illinois as a freshman honor society designed to promote academic achievement among male students.  Alpha Lambda Delta was originally founded as an honor society strictly for women at the University of Illinois in 1924.  A chapter was founded at Purdue University in 1926.  In the mid-1970s, Alpha Lambda Delta and Phi Eta Sigma became co-ed national honor societies.  Each of these societies operates separately at the national level.  However, both Alpha Lambda Delta and Phi Eta Sigma operate as one entity on the Purdue University campus, as well as many other campuses across the nation.  The goals of both honor societies are better served when operating as a single team dedicated to academic excellence and community service.
  Alpha Lambda Delta Phi Eta Sigma promotes hard work and dedication in and out of the classroom.  By encouraging incoming freshmen to earn a 3.5 GPA, the honor society creates a strong foundation for later collegiate success.  In addition to helping young college students develop and realize goals within their academic curriculum, Alpha Lambda Delta Phi Eta Sigma encourages students to recognize achievable goals within the community.  Alpha Lambda Delta Phi Eta Sigma and its members participate in a variety of community service projects each year. 
  The Purdue University chapter is no exception to this national standard.  Officers and volunteers from the campus chapter offer a well-developed tutoring program for children who reside in Purdue Village.  Serving Thanksgiving dinner at the local homeless shelter, ringing bells for the Salvation Army, and participating in the Walk for Life are just a few of the ever-increasing and ever-changing examples of the community service performed by Purdue University members.  The local chapter also sponsors the Boiler Academic Super Bowl where various student organizations have the opportunity to form teams and compete in academic challenges to raise money for the local Lafayette Adult Resource Academy.  Each year, the chapter officers seek new projects for member involvement.  It is the goal of Alpha Lambda Delta Phi Eta Sigma's Purdue officers to participate in at least one service project each month. 
  From its promotion of scholastic achievement to its strong involvement in the local community, Alpha Lambda Delta Phi Eta Sigma at Purdue University demonstrates its dedication to the growth and positive development of its members.  It certainly proves to be an excellent student organization for participation.

It was created to be an organization that would allow students to exchange ideas and develop their professional networks. By 1959, Alpha Pi Mu became a part of the Association of College Honors Societies (ACHS), making it the only nationally accepted honors society for Industrial Engineering.
  Our Purdue University chapter is one of over 60 active chapters that exist today. Our mission is to recognize junior and senior students who have demonstrated academic excellence in the Department of Industrial Engineering and encourage them to further their knowledge and develop a strong professional network. APM frequently works with the other IE societies, such as IISE (Institute of Industrial and Systems Engineers), to offer programs and activities to all of the Engineering students of Purdue.
  Membership is by invitation only to third year IE students in the top one fifth of their IE class and to fourth year IE students in the top one third of their IE class. Members work to improve the surrounding community by performing acts and duties that bring a greater understanding of Industrial Engineering to Indiana. On top of our community focus, Purdue's chapter aims to help its members in various capacities that provide value to their career and educational aspirations.
  Why should you join Alpha Pi Mu?
Direct connections to networking opportunities with alumni, faculty, and company representatives
Access to professional development resources for suggestions on resumes, interviews, and visa/sponsorship information
Life membership and society award scholarship opportunities
Leadership opportunities within the school of industrial engineering
Advice from fellow IE students in different classes
Social, corporate, and career networking events and activities

On October 5, 1920, the Nu of Kappa Alpha Psi was charted by Brothers Lionel F. Artis, Howard Dangerfield, Robert L. Bailey, Lucien B. Merriweather, Theodore W. Cable, and Frederick D. Smith in an effort to further the dream of our 10 astute founders to achieve in every field of human endeavor, and inspire service at the same time. The brothers of Nu are proud to live vicariously through the men who created this great fraternity and give back to the greater Purdue and Lafayette communities. 
  As an undergraduate chapter, we are responsible for assisting the aims and purposes of colleges and universities, another founding objective. We strive to achieve this by partnering with other on-campus organizations in an effort to create a welcoming environment for everyone in the Purdue community to thrive.
  Evolved from a 1921 program by Brother Leon W. Steward of the St. Louis Alumni Chapter, Guide Right was adopted as the national service program of Kappa Alpha Psi at the 12th Grand Chapter Meeting. Guide Right was founded to inspire service in the public’s interest by involving young men, primarily of African-American descent, in development and preparation programs. More than 100 years later, we are committed to seeing this through by starting a Guide Right program of our own, focused on the development of young men so they may succeed in professional spaces and to grow as individuals.
  Kappa Alpha Psi was founded to unite college men of culture, patriotism, and honor in a bond of fraternity. Nu chapter has always been notorious for having a strong brotherhood, among other things, which is where we derived our signature chant: Notorious Nu Chapter is a fruitful chapter, and the brotherly love found here shall never perish!

As a Brother of Kappa Pi Beta, I will strive hard to further the existence of this great fraternity. I will do my best to bring forth a bond of unity to all of my fellow Brothers that will stand the test of time. Along with the close relationships that are built, I pledge to promote academic excellence, brotherhood, cultural awareness, social mobility, philanthropy, gentlemen values, and respect towards the individual and community. Regardless of the letters I wear, what organizations I am in, or national origin, I will set the example that unity is the ultimate beginning of Brotherhood. I will use these attributes as development of my character and retain them even beyond my years of higher learning.
Vision
Through the practices of respect and etiquette, a GENTLEMAN of Kappa Pi Beta will adopt an agenda that proactively seeks to defy the stereotypes of the typical fraternity and create the ideals of unity within the community. By these premises, a stronger voice in representation among Asian Americans will generate.
Purpose
The Kappa Pi Beta Fraternity is an Asian American-founded service and social fraternity dedicated to the needs of the community alongside a commitment of higher learning, the promotion of the traditional Asian values of respect and discipline, and the overall essence of unity among all people of different background.
Philanthropy
  Asian Americans are generally not seen as overweight compared to the rest of the U.S. population. However, they are actually at a greater risk of developing diabetes, as Asian Americans often develop diabetes at a lower BMI. Furthermore, Asian Americans have the highest proportion of undiagnosed diabetes among all ethnic and racial groups (at 51 percent). Currently, 60% of the world diabetic population is Asian. Our Fraternity seeks to actively educate and work with the American Diabetes Association, through volunteering and fundraising, to build awareness and combat this growing concern among our community.
  American Diabetes Association
The American Diabetes Association is a United States-based association working to fight the consequences of diabetes and to help those affected by diabetes and as Brothers of Kappa Pi Beta Fraternity, Inc. we actively partake in the ADA’s events and make semi-annual donations from our Chapters.

If you are interested in the club just show up ready to train and with a good attitude. Make sure to tell the instructor that you are new to the club. We understand that some might end class late so we have tolerance for being reasonably late.

Isolation and social disengagement often impact and impair the lives of patients in long-term residential care facilities, whose families may have given up long ago. By pairing university students 1:1 with dementia patients, volunteers can not only improve the lives of patients, but also further their interpersonal and personal competencies. Overall, AB is for students who are interested in learning about neurodegenerative diseases and wish to gain hands-on-experience with patients. Throughout the student’s time in the organization, they will pair with a patient, meet with them once a week, and foster a genuine connection. The organization holds monthly meetings with active members, but commitment mainly entails regular connection with one’s Buddy. Any Purdue University student is welcome to join and assist in the creation of a community where passionate young adults dare to enter the unknown and find comfort in connection. Together, we meet patients where they are at and focus on the most important components of life - human connection, kindness, and warmth. You’ll be surprised at the impact you can have.

         Since its founding on December 4, 1906, Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Inc. has supplied voice and vision to the struggle of African-Americans and people of color around the world. Alpha Phi Alpha, the first intercollegiate Greek-letter fraternity established for African-Americans, was founded at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York by seven college men who recognized the need for a strong bond of Brotherhood among African descendants in this country. The visionary founders, known as the 'Jewels' of the Fraternity, are Henry Arthur Callis, Charles Henry Chapman, Eugene Kinckle Jones, George Biddle Kelley, Nathaniel Allison Murray, Robert Harold Ogle, and Vertner Woodson Tandy.

       The Fraternity initially served as a study and support group for minority students who faced racial prejusdice, both educationally and socially, at Cornell. The Jewel founders and early leaders of the Fraternity succeeded in laying a firm foundation for Alpha Phi Alpha's principles of scholarship, fellowship, moral character, and the uplifting of humanity.
       Gamma Rho Chapter of Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Inc. was established at Purdue University on April 24, 1948 by the following charter members. James C. Butler, Chester L. French, Raymond L. Hall, Milton B. Kendrick, John E. Littman, William N. Lovelace, Jimmie Mosley John E. Rudder, Richard Wallace, Walter H. White and George A. Younger. Since its founding at Purdue University, Gamma Rho Chapter boasts a rich legacy of producing successful men.

      Gamma Rho Chapter has maintained the fraternity's tradition of excellence in manly deeds, scholarship, and great regard of all mankind. As a demonstration of this commitment, the chapter sponsors a myriad of community service events including: Annual Voter's Registration Drive, Study Tables & Tutoring, Big Brothers Big Sisters mentoring, Food & Clothing Drives for the Needy, along with Alpha Phi Alpha's mandated programs.

         Affectionately known as ""Gangsta Gamma Rho,"" the Brothers continue the rich tradition of community uplift and empowerment, as we live true to the Alpha motto: First of All, Servants of All, We Shall Transcend All.

Isolation and social disengagement often impact and impair the lives of patients in long-term residential care facilities, whose families may have given up long ago. By pairing university students 1:1 with dementia patients, volunteers can not only improve the lives of patients, but also further their interpersonal and personal competencies. Overall, AB is for students who are interested in learning about neurodegenerative diseases and wish to gain hands-on-experience with patients. Throughout the student’s time in the organization, they will pair with a patient, meet with them once a week, and foster a genuine connection. The organization holds monthly meetings with active members, but commitment mainly entails regular connection with one’s Buddy. Any Purdue University student is welcome to join and assist in the creation of a community where passionate young adults dare to enter the unknown and find comfort in connection. Together, we meet patients where they are at and focus on the most important components of life - human connection, kindness, and warmth. You’ll be surprised at the impact you can have.

Founded in 1989 by Anthony K. Shriver, Best Buddies is a vibrant international organization that has grown from one original chapter at Georgetown University to more than 2,300 chapters worldwide, positively impacting the lives of over 1.1 million people with and without IDD. Best Buddies programs engage participants in each of the 50 United States, and in over 50 countries around the world. Best Buddies is the world’s largest organization dedicated to ending the social, physical and economic isolation of the 200 million people with IDD. For individuals within this community, Best Buddies helps them form meaningful friendships with their peers, secure successful jobs, live independently, improve public speaking, self-advocacy and communications skills, and feel valued by society.

The vision: to put Best Buddies out of business. Best Buddies envisions a world where people with IDD are so successfully integrated into schools, workplaces and communities that its current efforts and services will be unnecessary. Until that vision becomes a reality, the organization will continue to educate middle school, high school and college students, community members, corporations and employers about the emotional, functional, and natural needs and abilities of people with IDD.

Founded in Iran in 1844, it now has more than five million adherents in 236 countries and territories. Baha'is come from nearly every national, ethnic and religious background, making the Baha'i Faith the second-most-widespread religion in the world.
  Baha'is view the world's major religions as a part of a single, progressive process through which God reveals His will to humanity. Baha'u'llah (1817-1892), the Founder of the Baha'i Faith, is recognized as the most recent in a line of Divine Messengers that includes Abraham, Moses, Buddha, Zoroaster, Christ and Muhammad.
  The central theme of Baha'u'llah's message is that humanity is one single race and that the day has come for humanity’s unification into one global society. While reaffirming the core ethical principles common to all religions, Baha'u'llah also revealed new laws and teachings to lay the foundations of a global civilization. “A new life,” Baha'u'llah declared, “is, in this age, stirring within all the peoples of the earth.”
  The worldwide Baha'i community, composed of people from virtually every racial, ethnic and religious background, is working to give practical expression to Baha'u'llah’s vision of world unity. We invite you to learn more about the Baha'i Faith and benefit from the spiritual and practical insights found in the Revelation of Baha'u'llah, God's message for humanity in this day.

         Since its founding on December 4, 1906, Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Inc. has supplied voice and vision to the struggle of African-Americans and people of color around the world. Alpha Phi Alpha, the first intercollegiate Greek-letter fraternity established for African-Americans, was founded at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York by seven college men who recognized the need for a strong bond of Brotherhood among African descendants in this country. The visionary founders, known as the 'Jewels' of the Fraternity, are Henry Arthur Callis, Charles Henry Chapman, Eugene Kinckle Jones, George Biddle Kelley, Nathaniel Allison Murray, Robert Harold Ogle, and Vertner Woodson Tandy.

       The Fraternity initially served as a study and support group for minority students who faced racial prejusdice, both educationally and socially, at Cornell. The Jewel founders and early leaders of the Fraternity succeeded in laying a firm foundation for Alpha Phi Alpha's principles of scholarship, fellowship, moral character, and the uplifting of humanity.
       Gamma Rho Chapter of Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Inc. was established at Purdue University on April 24, 1948 by the following charter members. James C. Butler, Chester L. French, Raymond L. Hall, Milton B. Kendrick, John E. Littman, William N. Lovelace, Jimmie Mosley John E. Rudder, Richard Wallace, Walter H. White and George A. Younger. Since its founding at Purdue University, Gamma Rho Chapter boasts a rich legacy of producing successful men.

      Gamma Rho Chapter has maintained the fraternity's tradition of excellence in manly deeds, scholarship, and great regard of all mankind. As a demonstration of this commitment, the chapter sponsors a myriad of community service events including: Annual Voter's Registration Drive, Study Tables & Tutoring, Big Brothers Big Sisters mentoring, Food & Clothing Drives for the Needy, along with Alpha Phi Alpha's mandated programs.

         Affectionately known as ""Gangsta Gamma Rho,"" the Brothers continue the rich tradition of community uplift and empowerment, as we live true to the Alpha motto: First of All, Servants of All, We Shall Transcend All.

Purdue University is committed to an inclusive and welcoming experience for all students. To that end, the Disability Resource Center (DRC) is the office designated by Purdue to provide services, resources, and programs to facilitate equal access for disabled students, resulting in their full participation in curricular and co-curricular offerings.
The DRC serves disabled undergraduate and graduate students enrolled at Purdue’s West Lafayette campus and Purdue Polytechnic Institute Statewide Programs, whether part-time or full-time (including students taking online courses). The DRC strives to proactively identify and remove barriers to access, promote inclusion and minimize the need for individual accommodations. The DRC also determines whether students are eligible for reasonable accommodation and, if so, the nature of the reasonable accommodation. The DRC does not test for, diagnose, or treat disability but relies on third-party documentation when determining accommodations.
What informs the DRC's work?
Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA): In accordance with ADA and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, Section 504, no qualified person will be denied access to, participation in, or the benefits of, any program or activity operated by the University because of disability.
Social Justice: Disability is an aspect of diversity, integral to our society and to the Purdue community. All disabled students are valued members of the Purdue community and should have equitable access to all curricular and co-curricular offerings of the university. The DRC works to ensure that access is provided seamlessly, with minimal additional burden on the disabled student.
Universal Design: The DRC promotes universal design, the idea that experiences should be usable by all people to the greatest extent possible, ideally without the need for individual adjustments. Identifying and removing barriers to access in the design process can result in an enhanced experience for all participants and reduce the need for individual accommodations.
Disability Studies: Disability Studies is a multi- and interdisciplinary academic field of inquiry that defines impairment as naturally occurring on the continuum of human difference. Experts in the field challenge the dated view of disability as an individual deficit or defect, emphasizing instead that individuals are disabled by their environments, not by their impairments.

Friendship
Scholarship
Leadership
Service

Cooperative houses have been a part of Purdue University for 75 years.  In a cooperative house, students live and work together to promote friendship, leadership, and life skills. Currently, Purdue is home to 11 cooperative houses - 4 men's houses and 7 women's houses.

Dozens of Purdue University student organizations and departments are teaming up to provide substance-free activities for students during the annual Grand Prix celebration.
Grand Prix Week (Alternative) is a program designed to offer substance-free events to the Purdue campus community during Grand Prix week (April 16-23). Grand Alternative was started in 1998 by the Wesley Foundation at Purdue (United Methodist Student Center) under the leadership of the Reverend Steve Cain, and student Amy Pritchard. 12 student groups hosted six events during the week prior to Grand Prix.
The Student Activities and Organizations office has served as the central office of the Grand Alternative initiative since 2001.  
The primary goal of Grand Prix Week (Alternative) is to empower student organization leaders to help provide solutions to high-risk and underage drinking problems at Purdue. By providing substance-free choices for Purdue students, the intent is that fewer acts of violence and vandalism will occur and fewer negative consequences from alcohol use will occur.

NPHC promotes interaction through forums, meetings and other mediums for the exchange of information and engages in cooperative programming and initiatives through various activities and functions.
On May 10, 1930, on the campus of Howard University, in Washington DC, the National Pan-Hellenic Council was formed as a permanent organization with the following charter members: Omega Psi Phi and Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternities, and Alpha Kappa Alpha, Delta Sigma Theta and Zeta Phi Beta Sororities. In 1931, Alpha Phi Alpha and Phi Beta Sigma Fraternities joined the Council. Sigma Gamma Rho Sorority joined in 1937 and Iota Phi Theta Fraternity completed the list of member organizations in 1997.
The stated purpose and mission of the organization in 1930 was “Unanimity of thought and action as far as possible in the conduct of Greek letter collegiate fraternities and sororities, and to consider problems of mutual interest to its member organizations.” Early in 1937, the organization was incorporated under the laws of the State of Illinois and became known as “The National Pan-Hellenic Council, Incorporated.”
  Previously the Black Greek Council (BGC), the Purdue Chapter has been affiliated with the National Pan-Hellenic Council, Inc. since 2000. From it's inception, the local affiliates have made great strides to carry out our motto of ""Where there is unity, there is strength.""

We bring an unusual level of curiosity and a unique perspective to everything we do. We sing for the sake of singing, and while our rehearsals are informal, we care deeply about the music, one another, and giving high-quality performances. Many of the members are students in Barrett, the Honors College (and earn honors credit for their participation), but any motivated student from the university is welcome to join. Members play an important role in all aspects of the choir’s work, from choosing repertory to organizing social events to day-to-day musical decisions. We generally give two concerts each semester. One program each year is a pops concert made up mainly of student-organized solos and small ensembles. Rehearsals and performances share the joy and delight of making music together.
  AUDITION/HEARING: New members have a brief hearing for the conductor at the beginning of the semester. This involves singing simple vocal patterns, pitch-matching, and singing a familiar song like “Happy Birthday.” The purpose is mainly to determine the most appropriate voice part for you to sing in the choir.

AFSA is open to anybody that is interested in learning about and enjoying African culture. AFSA prides itself in creating a sense of community for students of African descent on campus and strives to educate its campus community on Africa-related topics. The African Students' Association aims to be a social forum for all students of African descent as well as all students who are interested in sharing the African experience at Arizona State University. Article II – Non-Discrimination Statement Membership and all privileges, including voting and officer positions, must be extended to all students without regard to age, ethnicity, gender, disability, color, national origin, race, religion, sexual orientation, or veteran status. Title IX of the Educational Amendments of 1972, Section 106.14, makes an exception for social fraternities and sororities, in regard to gender, for membership criteria. Religious student organizations will not be denied registration solely because they limit membership or leadership positions to students who share the same religious beliefs. These groups, however, may not discriminate in membership or leadership on any other prohibited basis (i.e., age, ethnicity, gender, disability, color, national origin, race, sexual orientation, or veteran status).

  In such meetings, we discuss various challenges one might face such as the cultural differences between corporate life and the culture members may have been raised in.

Our members—at 50 colleges and universities, as well as in Miami, New York City, San Francisco, and Washington, DC—are united by basic convictions about the United States and its role in the world:
• A measured pride in the success of the American experiment; an understanding that America’s greatness is the result of its commitment to individual liberty, limited government, economic freedom, the rule of law, human dignity, and democracy; and a belief that the fundamental aim of every aspect of our policy, foreign and domestic, must be to defend these principles at home and ultimately to encourage their spread abroad;
• A conviction, rooted in the history of the last century, that the world is a better, safer, and more prosperous place when the United States is willing and able to lead; and a commitment to maintaining the moral authority and material strength on which that leadership rests;
• An appreciation that the world remains a dangerous place in which our power must be exercised with prudence, and where the primary threats to our security come from states that deny freedom to their own people and from non-state actors who embrace hatred and violence;
• A clear recognition that, in such a world, our true friends and reliable partners are other democratic nations with whom we share an enduring commonality of values, and not simply a temporary convergence of interests;
• A firm belief that, time and again, in peace and in war, the ability of the American political system to profit from vigorous public discussion has proved its worth; and that, at this moment in our history, our public discussion of foreign, economic, and national security policy stands very much in need of renewal.

Our members—at 50 colleges and universities, as well as in Miami, New York City, San Francisco, and Washington, DC—are united by basic convictions about the United States and its role in the world:
• A measured pride in the success of the American experiment; an understanding that America’s greatness is the result of its commitment to individual liberty, limited government, economic freedom, the rule of law, human dignity, and democracy; and a belief that the fundamental aim of every aspect of our policy, foreign and domestic, must be to defend these principles at home and ultimately to encourage their spread abroad;
• A conviction, rooted in the history of the last century, that the world is a better, safer, and more prosperous place when the United States is willing and able to lead; and a commitment to maintaining the moral authority and material strength on which that leadership rests;
• An appreciation that the world remains a dangerous place in which our power must be exercised with prudence, and where the primary threats to our security come from states that deny freedom to their own people and from non-state actors who embrace hatred and violence;
• A clear recognition that, in such a world, our true friends and reliable partners are other democratic nations with whom we share an enduring commonality of values, and not simply a temporary convergence of interests;
• A firm belief that, time and again, in peace and in war, the ability of the American political system to profit from vigorous public discussion has proved its worth; and that, at this moment in our history, our public discussion of foreign, economic, and national security policy stands very much in need of renewal.

Our primary mission is to foster the spiritual growth of our ASU Catholic community through Christ-centered events, speakers and activities throughout the year. We form faithful Catholics according to the intellectual, spiritual, liturgical and moral heritage of our Christian tradition, and so equip them to mature as the saints that they are called to be. Our secondary mission is to dialogue with the wider student body - those of other faiths or no faith at all - and share with them the riches of our ancient faith as handed on to us by God's own divine Son, Jesus.
Whether you are a Catholic looking to mature in your faith, a ""seeker"" just wanting to find out more, or looking for Christian friendships - please know that you are most welcome at Newman. Our campus is at the corner of College and University - look for the red brick church. See our calendar or subscribe to our Instagram channel @asucatholic for the latest offerings.
We especially invite you to our main weekly event - Newman Nights, with a talk and dinner - on Wednesday evenings throughout the year - no reservations needed! Every Wednesday, we have one of three events:
Newman Night: Men and Women's Small Groups: 
Embrace who you are and envision who you want to become. Join us for our highly anticipated Men's and Women's nights, held monthly on Wednesdays. Forge unbreakable bonds of brotherhood and sisterhood while exploring the profound teachings of Christian views on masculinity and femininity. Don't miss out on these transformative opportunities! Mark your calendars and find your purpose with us. Check the Google calendar for small group dates
Newman Night: Christ on Campus:
Experience the ancient and profound practice of Eucharistic Adoration, where we worship Christ in the Eucharist, fully present in body, blood, soul, and divinity. This cherished tradition stems from the collective worship we share during Mass, reinforcing our belief in Christ's true presence among us.
Countless Catholics over the ages have discovered the transformative power of Eucharistic Adoration, as it intensifies prayer and establishes a profound connection with God. Beholding Christ in the Blessed Sacrament allows us to delve into the mystery of God's boundless love, harmonizing our prayers with our hearts and minds.
Led by passionate student leaders and guided by our devoted priests or deacons, Christ on Campus offers you an extraordinary opportunity to engage in prayerful communion with the Eucharistic King. Once a month, we invite you to pause, reflect, journal, pray with uplifting music, and bask in the serene presence of the Eucharist. The Sacrament of Reconciliation awaits those seeking spiritual renewal during this time as well
Newman Night: Witness
Twice a month, at the Newman Center you are invited to hear from inspiring and faith-filled speakers! Brace yourself for captivating talks that will ignite your curiosity and broaden your horizons. And the best part? The discussion doesn't end there! Stick around after the talk and relish a delightful, complimentary meal while exchanging ideas with like-minded individuals.
We extend this invitation to all students, so gather your friends and join us for intellectually stimulating evenings that will leave you inspired

It was established during the 1930s, and the original callsign was W7TJV. In 1997 the club obtained the vanity callsign W7ASU, and in 2008 established a permanent station just north of the main campus in Tempe, Arizona, thanks to donated equipment from the family of Richard S. Juvet Jr. (WB7CDK/SK), the academic advisor for the club during the 1970s and 1980s. As of 2023, we have OVER 50 active members!
  W7ASU has a long tradition of communications service on campus and in the communities of Tempe and the surrounding greater Phoenix area. The club aims to mentor interested students and incoming members in Basic/Radio-Electronics, Amateur Radio Rules and Regulations among other things and help prepare for the FCC Amateur Radio Technicians Licensing Exam.
  By nature, amateur radio encompasses so many areas of educational content, such as science, engineering, technology, and math (STEM). Whether you are in a technical degree program, or not, you can gain valuable knowledge and skills by learning some of the aspects of amateur radio. This information can enhance your field of study regardless of the major.
  W7ASU allows you, the student, to explore past and present radio technologies, as well as participate in an international community with other amateur radio stations and operators around the world simply using the radio airwaves…no internet!
  Joining the ARS@ASU is free. The club's membership is Open to all ASU Students and Faculty and there are 'NO PRE-REQUISITES' to be involved in the club or its activities. HOWEVER, you MUST be a LICENSED FCC operator or operate under one in order to participate in our various transmitter operations.
  Participation in our events is voluntary, but participation in a school club looks great on your resume!
  Members of the ASU community can sign up on Sun Devil Sync (https://asu.campuslabs.com/engage/):  search for ""Amateur Radio Club"" and request to join.

A new rotor with computer interfaced control was installed in 2022. The club will also lend handheld VHF/UHF transceivers to licensed club members.

  The Veterans Club is a peer support group designed to ensure higher education success for veterans of the armed forces, their dependents, and supporters of the military currently attending ASU.

To be successful, Veterans must encourage collaboration among diverse units and stakeholders as well as eliminate the walls and barriers to education, prosperity, and wellness. We must eliminate the hedgerows that divide us and help redefine the relationship of our institutions: public and private, nonprofit and for profit, local, state and federal. By doing so, we will alter the trajectory of Veterans and redefine the roles that we play in education, in the economy, and in our communities. We look forward to having you be a part of this new model for Veteran success.

Meetings for Spring 2020 have all been conducted.  Meeting are in the Polytechnic Campus Pat Tillman Veterans Center enclave.  Future meetings will be posted here:

AFSA is open to anybody that is interested in learning about and enjoying African culture. AFSA prides itself in creating a sense of community for students of African descent on campus and strives to educate its campus community on Africa-related topics. The African Students' Association aims to be a social forum for all students of African descent as well as all students who are interested in sharing the African experience at Arizona State University. Article II – Non-Discrimination Statement Membership and all privileges, including voting and officer positions, must be extended to all students without regard to age, ethnicity, gender, disability, color, national origin, race, religion, sexual orientation, or veteran status. Title IX of the Educational Amendments of 1972, Section 106.14, makes an exception for social fraternities and sororities, in regard to gender, for membership criteria. Religious student organizations will not be denied registration solely because they limit membership or leadership positions to students who share the same religious beliefs. These groups, however, may not discriminate in membership or leadership on any other prohibited basis (i.e., age, ethnicity, gender, disability, color, national origin, race, sexual orientation, or veteran status).

Founded in 1908, her roots date back to Howard University, Washington, D.C., where the idea for formation was conceived by Ethel Hedgeman Lyle of St. Louis, Missouri. She viewed the Sorority as an instrument for enriching the social and intellectual aspects of college life by providing mental stimulation through interaction with friends and associates. Through the years, however, Alpha Kappa Alpha’s function has become more complex. After her incorporation as a perpetual body in 1913, Alpha Kappa Alpha gradually branched out and became the channel through which selected college-trained women improved the socioeconomic conditions in their city, state, nation and the world. Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Incorporated is based on the principles of sisterhood, scholarship, and service to ALL mankind. Alpha Kappa Alpha has grown through the years to become an international organization with a membership in excess of 200,000 women. Membership in our organization consists of women of distinction and exemplary character. These women excel in all areas of life and work closely with the community. Alpha Kappa Alpha has undergraduate and graduate chapters located in the United States, West Africa, Great Britain, the Bahamas, the Virgin Islands, Korea and Germany.

Changing immigration legal systems and policies can be difficult to understand. In order to be allies in this movement, our work thus includes visiting Stewart Detention Center, letter-writing to detained immigrants, and connecting with Emory faculty, legal experts, and Atlanta organizations well-versed on institutional aspects of US immigration.
Students can maintain connections with detainees at Stewart Detention Center, the largest private detention facility in the US. They conduct humanitarian visits with undocumented immigrants detained at Stewart Detention Center. Amidst the pandemic, we have created a pen-pal program between detained immigrants and Emory University students, staff, and faculty. These are both a way of creating friendships with those separated and isolated, but also ensuring all detainees are living under sound conditions. Through letter writing corresponded and visitations, we, as a community, can gain a deeper understanding of the issue of immigration and detention from both factual and personal perspectives. We also plan to host panel events with guest speakers from leading law offices, organizations, and assemblies across the country who advocate for immigrant rights.

Beloved Community at Emory",https://emory.campuslabs.com/engage/organization/belovedcommunity,,"Beloved Community is Emory’s progressive, ecumenical Protestant worshipping community. Beloved Community’s membership includes currently registered Emory undergraduate students, but others are invited to join in worship and activities, including graduate/professional students, faculty, staff, and members of the wider community. A central value of Beloved community is contextualizing our faith within the current sociocultural context. People of all racial, cultural, and religious backgrounds are welcomed and affirmed. Beloved Community cultivates a sense of belonging through worship and lunch together after our services. We foster an inclusive environment through the diversity of voices we lift up each week.
  Beloved Community has its roots in a tradition of University Worship that began at Emory in the late 1960s during an important time of racial integration. It was felt at the time that there were not worship opportunities in the local area that were deeply inclusive of people of all races, and so the Emory university chaplain and students began University Worship. The community has always maintained a progressive, inclusive Christian worshipping community, which in time grew to include the full inclusion of LGBTQIA+ members in this Christian community. As Emory has broadened in its religious diversity, the community adopted the more modest name of “Beloved Community,” echoing a central theological concept for The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Today, Beloved Community continues to offer the only regular Protestant worship service in Emory’s Cannon Chapel on Sunday mornings during the academic term. It is a link to Emory’s United Methodist heritage that welcomes all into creative and ecumenical Christian worship that is intended to center the needs of current Emory students. Preachers come from the Emory community, including students, as well as prominent guests. Other aspects of our organization’s life include fellowship meals, Bible studies, retreats, the celebration of major Christian holidays and seasons, and works of service and social justice.

Transfer and freshmen students are greeted in the fall at the club's Welcome Back picnic where old members reunite and new members begin to form lasting friendships. General club meetings are held every first and third Thursday of the month, with the board of directors meetings being held on alternative weeks. New students have ample opportunities to become involved with the club and are encouraged to participate as they are required to assist with at least four events to become an initiated member.
The diverse background of club members allows the interests in all species of livestock to be well represented at club events. Block and Bridle's equine enthusiasts participate in several horse related events throughout the year. Students become involved with horses on campus by participating in weanling and mare handling/grooming and also by assisting with the Penn State Quarter Horse spring sale. Students with a meat interest help with ham processing for the fall and spring meat sales. Those with cattle experience assist with the State Bull Test Sale where approximately 100 bulls are clipped every spring. Sheep fans help with the Keystone International Livestock exposition. Also, members with a judging passion have the opportunity to run several livestock and horse judging contests. Members volunteer at the Keystone International Livestock Exposition and The Penn State Spring Judging Workout. Members with a goat interest help with the club's newest annual event, an American Boer Goat Association sanctioned show each fall. While most club members have a specific species of interest, all members are encouraged and welcome to participate in every event.
We Are…Penn State! Club members have a lot of school spirit and regularly attend Penn State footballs games together and cheer in the infamous student section. Students share their Penn State pride by helping to host the annual Prospective Student Open House. High school Students have the opportunity to visit campus for two days and experience life as a College of Agricultural Sciences student first hand. In addition to showing school spirit, club members also enjoy educating campus about the College of Agricultural Sciences. 
Blood for Bats is now in its thirteenth year as a club activity. Blood is harvested from cattle at the PSU Meats Lab and delivered to the Philadelphia Zoo as the primary food source for their vampire bat colonies. The zoo appreciates the club's efforts as we have consistently delivered blood with low microbial counts.
Each year, Block and Bridle hits the road to proudly represent Penn State at the National Block and Bridle Convention. Members benefit from networking with other Block and Bridle members from across the country. This year 15 members of the club traveled to Lincoln, Nebraska for convention. In February, Fifteen Block and Bridle students joined forces with Dairy Science Club members at the University of Rhode Island for the North East Student Affiliate (NESA). Contestants judged livestock classes consisting of horses, dairy cows, beef heifers, market hogs, breeding ewes, and oysters. Members also participated in quiz bowl competitions and oral presentations. Penn State was well represented with an overall count of 7 teams; we made our school proud as well as our devoted advisors by being named the 1st place Overall University at the competition. Penn State had the 1st place team overall, 1st and 2nd place teams in quiz bowl, 1st and 3rd place speeches, and 2nd place team in judging.
Block and Bridle is proud of their contributions to the Penn State community. We wrapped up the academic year by hosting and contributing to our Beef Up the Blood Supply spring blood drive. It is the largest Penn State blood drive held on campus and provides donors with a nutritious hamburger following their donation. We have had a pretty good turn out in the past few years.
Along with the many service activities, club members, initiates, and advisors enjoy each other's company throughout the semester at many social events. Members could be found playing bowling at Northland Bowl downtown in the fall. In the winter, our club was seen watching the very popular movie Encanto and singing along. Many club members showcased their athletic talent by participating in intramural (IM) football, and dodge-ball at Penn State.
  Little International, or Little I, is one of the most anticipated events of the year and Block and Bridle would not be complete without this long-standing tradition. This year, the Little International celebrated its 104th year as a long standing tradition with Block and Bridle at the Pennsylvania State University. Fifty students participated this year, while more than one hundred alumni came back for the show. The morning started with the opening ceremony followed by the introduction of the judges who were each show managers or assistant show managers of previous shows. The event concluded with a round robin, where the overall showmen for each species competed against each other for Overall Champion Showman. The Stockmen's club, the Block and Bridle alumni group, partnered with Block & Bridle to make this year's event a success, providing both breakfast and lunch. Additionally, alumni were given the opportunity to participate in a livestock judging contest. Participants perfected their fitting and showmanship skills and were able to display their hard work to a full Snider Agricultural Arena.
Club members are excited to debut a new prestigious club sponsored by Block and Bridle: The Penn State Saddle & Sirloin Club. This club was created to raise additional funds every year for the club's endowment account, which will benefit the club in years to come. In order to gain membership to the club a beautiful saddle, donated by Roger Allgeier of Brighton Feeds & Saddlery in Brighton, Colorado, must be ""bought."" The saddle remains in the room of traditions at Penn State and plaques are placed on a latigo strap recognizing the newest owner and member of the club. This spring was our inaugural sale and the saddle sold for $5000. A very generous alumnus, Bill MacCauley, matched the sale price to bring the final total to $10,000 for the endowment account! The latigo strap will gain a plaque honoring Dr. Harold Harpster, a very influential faculty member at Penn State, and Vivian Baumer, a previous adviser to the club who passed away this spring.
As you can tell, Block and Bridle members stay busy year round with club activities. Club advisors Dr. Daniel Kniffen, Dr. Ed Mills, Mr. Chris Grant, and Mr. Ben Williamson are proud of our hard work and accomplishments and continue to offer their time and support. We maintain a tradition as one of the dominant clubs on Ag Hill and strive to continue that tradition of excellence as members before, during, and after each club event.

DNA Day at PSU is one of many growing chapters across the nation and the second chapter to be established in Pennsylvania! As a science outreach program, our collective DNA Day Network mission is to break down the barriers to science and bridge the gap between research institutions and the public by promoting young adult's interest in science. To accomplish this goal, DNA Day at PSU has partnered with local Pennsylvania high schools with an emphasis on underserved communities that have limited opportunities for science outreach and exposure. Our Penn State chapter pairs scientists with local high school teachers to present interactive module lessons and hands-on workshops to teach students about DNA, the latest advances in Genetics and Genomics research and technology, and exciting career paths in the field. This program also gives high school students the unique opportunity to interact with early-career scientists and break down misconceptions about who scientists are and how we carry out our own original research, thereby demystifying scientists as a whole and expanding career options many high school students have not previously considered.

Today, it operates 36 active chapters and colonies and over 25,000 initiated members.
Alpha Kappa Lambda was founded on April 22, 1914 by a group of young men attending the University of California, Berkeley. Its birth, however, dates back to 1906 when a group of friends discussed the “need of Christian men for a place to live and study that was within their (financial) means.”
After assisting in the cleanup of the Great 1906 San Francisco Earthquake, four students re-addressed their desire to organize a house club during a YMCA conference in Pacific Grove, California. It was decided to form “Los Amigos” in 1907, which was a house club named from the Spanish translation of “The Friends.” Shortly after, seven more men joined Los Amigos. Reverend Gail Cleland, one of the original eleven members of Los Amigos, recalled, “When we organized Los Amigos as a house club, house clubs and fraternities were dime a dozen. They came, they lived for a few months or a few years, then they went out of existence again. But Los Amigos did not go out of existence.”
He continues, “And seven years later, in response to the suggestion of Benjamin Ide Wheeler, president of the University of California, we organized our house club as a national fraternity of one chapter.”
The founders of Los Amigos were a diverse group, but they shared a common desire for studious living in a college environment and continued integrity after their formal education concluded.

Our Values, once secret but made public in 2005, are what make us unique. Our Values call us to better ourselves through our actions and words. These are the values that we espouse:
SILENCE
He has the strength to embrace silence and the will to build an interior life founded upon an honest desire to truly listen to others. Trust in silence transcends the gulf that is created when men feel the need to compete in action or rhetoric. He is introspective and self-reliant.
CHARITY
He is charitable in the broadest sense of the word. A man who strives for a life of charity and service is more patient, kinder, and more forgiving of the flaws of others. A charitable man sacrifices of himself to help others and seeks no recognition in return. He is humble, reverent, and generous.
PURITY
He consistently strives for purity of mind, body, and soul. The man who is pure of thought, word, and deed does not shrink from adversity or lofty goals. There is no self-pity, rationalizations, or apologies. He is moral and a gentleman in the finest sense of the word.
HONOR
He lives a life of personal integrity, thereby accruing honor. An honorable man lives up to promises made to others and to himself. A man of honor is not vain, and is willing to endure scorn or ostracism rather than conform to the pressures of peers, superiors, or the fashion of the day. He is ethical, honest, and trustworthy.
PATRIOTISM
He loves his country, remaining consistently engaged in its affairs. He seeks to know his country and to pass that knowledge on to others. He is devoted to the principles of personal freedom, justice, and civic responsibility embedded in the U.S. Constitution that have made our country. He is loyal, proud, and humble.
Thus our Purpose is to Better the Man through the creation and perpetuation of brotherhood founded upon the values of character: Silence, Charity, Purity, Honor, and Patriotism.

We are learning that in order to be extraordinary healthcare professionals someday, we need to do more than successfully complete the rigorous curriculum that is set before us as we earn our degrees. The “Art of Nursing” organization is seeking to be a venue through which we can foster relationships and connections with the very patients/residents that we actually care for in the State College community. In addition, participating in the arts allows the members to increase empathy and therapeutic communication skills, which are very important in healthcare. 
Not only does this organization help those we perform for by promoting stress relief and healing, it also has a positive impact on the members by giving them a space to relieve stress and grow as caring individuals. 
Our current plan of action is to pair with nursing homes in the State College area, who will welcome us to perform for their residents. We hope to make this an interactive choir in which members are matched with one to three residents to sing and connect with during our visits. Many residents in nursing homes suffer from depression and anxiety, yet listening and making music is proven to help relieve some of the associated symptoms. As a group, we hope to uplift the residents and show them that they are important, cared for and loved. If interested, please join us in this mission!

As a special interest organization, we are very family focused. We are so lucky to have been paired with the Calvanelli family. Throughout the year we get to interact with our THON child, Ayrton, his brother Declan, and his parents, Nicole and Joe. Since we are a smaller organization we have a strong relationship with our family, each of our members typically has the opportunity to meet our family in person. This year we are looking into creative ways to have our members connect with the Calvanelli's! 
Axis is a family. We place an emphasis on getting to know our members and planning events that help us to grow together as an organization. There are chances both in the beginning of the year and throughout the year to get to know each of our members and chairs. We value non-THON related activities and social events that allow our members to develop stronger bonds with each other. On top of this, Axis offers many opportunities for leadership development.

Nutrition is one of the least talked about aspects of helping to treat and prevent a lot of diseases since medicine and pharmaceuticals are usually chosen as the first option by physicians. Many pateints are never introduced to the idea of making diet changes for prevention and management of a disease and often suffer harmful side effects of drugs or are unresponsive to the treatment.

  Welcome to Alpha Chi Sigma! UNC's chapter of Alpha Chi Sigma (AXS) was founded on May 6, 1912, and for 103 years the chapter has been dedicated to giving back to the community while using its vast chemistry knowledge as an advantage. In AXS, we pride ourselves on our service projects, such as hosting the Chemistry Merit Badge workshop for the Boy Scouts of America and entertaining the children in the Pediatric Playroom event at UNC Hospitals. In the past, we have partnered with the American Chemical Society in giving science demonstrations at the North Carolina State Fair, performed for the campus community during the NC Science Festival, volunteered at local Science Olympiad tournaments, and sponsored events at UNC's subset of DNA Day.
  While we are very service oriented, we always find time to have social lives as well. The people you meet in this fraternity are some of the best people you will meet during your time at UNC. Livelong friendships are made in AXS and you will not believe the impact it will have on your life. AXS changed my life for the better and I have no doubt it will yours as well.
AXS is open to all Chemistry, Biology, Neuroscience, Pre-med, Pre-pharmacy, as well as any other STEM major. For more information and to stay up to date with rush events and dates, follow us on Instagram: @axsigmarho

The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill is home to the NC Beta Chapter, founded in 1936. Our goal is to provide our members with valuable resources and experiences that will help guide them on their way to professional careers in health care, while also forming valuable friendships within the organization.
AED has three pillars of membership, including Academics, Service, and Social. Each of these areas has an important role in a member’s experience in our organization. Hear from members about their favorite parts of AED here. 
Our academic resources include regular lectures from health professionals, test prep courses, study groups, peer mentoring, and more. We have also been able to guarantee the opportunity to shadow a clinical health professional at least once during a member’s time in AED. Each Fall, our organization co-hosts a Medical School Deans Panel, made up of deans from major North Carolina Medical Schools (UNC, Duke, ECU, Wake Forest, etc.). These resources allow our members to network with professionals, explore different careers within health care, and to gain experience in fields in which they are most interested.
AED is also dedicated to service, and provides a large number of opportunities for students to volunteer on campus and in the local community. We have partnered with a wide variety of organizations in Chapel Hill for small and large service projects, including UNC Health Care, Orange County Habitat for Humanity, Ronald McDonald House, TABLE, MedWorld, Hope Gardens, and more. AED also hosts two on-campus philanthropy events each semester. Last year, our members put on “AED for the Kids,” a talent show for performance groups on campus to raise money for NC Children’s Hospital, and “Shaved by the Bell,” an event raising money for St. Baldrick’s Foundation, a nonprofit organization dedicated to childhood cancer research. While giving back to our community, our members work together, get to know each other, and foster connections that strengthen our brotherhood.
AED also hosts a number of social events throughout the semester for our members to spend time together outside the classroom, and to get to know each other better. Each year, members are invited to cocktails, mixers with other pre-professional organizations, a retreat, and a Spring formal. Smaller events include dinners, YoPo nights, game nights, and more! Our Big/Little mentoring program also partners new members with older members, allowing for fast friendships and guidance through the challenges of being a college student.
AED has a lot to offer, and we invite you to explore our website and participate in Fall or Spring Recruitment if you are interested in becoming a member. Please feel free to contact us with any questions about our organization - we look forward to hearing from you!

We have made award-winning animated short films for Campus Movie Fest and continue to create animations with the diverse talents of our club members.
  Watch our Introduction video here!
Join our Discord server for club event updates: https://discord.gg/uVuUVZhm8G
  FAQ:
I don’t know much about animation/I’m not a very good artist. Can I still join? 
Artists and animators of all skill levels are welcome! By collaborating with other artists in the club, you will learn lots of tips on how to improve! You can also contribute without needing to draw, such as through writing or production.
  What should I expect when I first join AniAno?
First, introduce yourself and share what you love about animation! Then, decide which roles in animation you want to contribute to. There are various roles such as storyboarding, character design, and animating. If you're not sure which roles suit you best, it's a good idea to try a little bit of everything and see what you enjoy doing most!
  What software does AniAno use?
Although club members tend to rely on the Adobe Creative Cloud suite provided for free by UNC (specifically Adobe Animate and Photoshop), you can use any digital art software you're comfortable with! There is also nothing wrong with good ol' paper and pencil!
  I am thinking of having a career in animation. Can AniAno help with that?
Yes! Aside from doing club projects, AniAno also explores the animation industry and offers resources for networking and portfolio building. You do not need to go to an art school to get into the animation industry. It's all about making lots of cool stuff and getting in touch with other animators!
    If you have any questions, please send us an email!

  Support:
We hold Culture Support Community and Culture Support Service to support both international students and endangered cultures. We will have an online community chat group for students to connect, and we will hold regular meetings for students to share their stories and support each other. As for Culture Support Service, we will offer a channel to encourage people worldwide to look for and collect endangered cultures. We will work together to discover how to commit to preserving global cultural identities and bring endangered cultures back.

We provide support for graduate students and post docs in the chemistry and physics and astronomy departments to create a more welcoming community for all members of STEM departments at UNC. We do this by inviting speakers from diverse backgrounds to speak to the community twice a year. We run a graduate peer-mentoring program (Graduate Achievement through Mentorship) to provide first-year graduate students the support they need.

Secondly, we aim to create connections with local and international leaders, organizations, and alumni to strengthen our community outside campus limits.
Thirdly, ASO aims to connect our members with outside career paths, promoting academic and employment opportunities to help ensure their success after graduation and beyond.

The Christian Legal Society of the University of North Carolina School of Law is a Christ-centered student group with a focus on fellowship, mentorship, and pro bono service. Our members include law students and professionals who are committed to glorifying God through spiritual formation, compassionate outreach, and the integration of faith and legal practice. All are welcome to join us!
Fellowship
Our society strives to support Christian students in their walk of faith through law school. As new students come to Chapel Hill each year, CLS works to get them connected with roommates, housing, churches, and community organizations. CLS enjoys a long tradition of hosting Christian leaders in the legal community who regularly address the group on important issues at the nexus of faith and law. Our list of distinguished speakers includes law school deans, members of congress, and North Carolina Supreme Court justices. In the middle of the busy life of law school, CLS provides a faith-based opportunity for law students to fellowship. In addition to our weekly lunch meetings where we gather for discussion, scripture reading, and prayer, our members often meet for group dinners, outdoor events, and worship services.
Mentorship
CLS provides a network for attorneys of faith to connect to the Christian legal community. New members benefit from mentorship with upperclassmen in law school and professionals in the field. Upperclassmen help new students navigate their way through the first years of school, providing guidance, insights, and friendship early on in the law school journey. CLS has a proud tradition of cultivating leaders in the law school and legal community. Our members are active in various student organizations such as the school journals, moot court, student bar association, and pro bono. Local professionals also partner with CLS to provide career advice and connections to young attorneys as they begin their post-graduate career. More information about our mentorship program can be found on the Mentorship page.
Pro Bono Service
UNC School of Law has a long and proud tradition of Pro Bono service in the North Carolina community. Our members are highly active in the Pro Bono and public interest projects, acting out their faith in service to others. CLS seeks to partner with organizations that have a faith or a family-oriented mission in their legal practice. Our Pro Bono coordinator is responsible for connecting our members with the right projects.

  THE CREED OF ALPHA TAU OMEGA
To bind men together in a brotherhood based upon eternal and immutable principles, with a bond as strong as right itself and as lasting as humanity; to know no North, no South, no East, no West, but to know man as man, to teach that true men the world over should stand together and contend for supremacy of good over evil; to teach, not politics, but morals; to foster, not partisanship, but the recognition of true merit wherever found; to have no narrower limits within which to work together for the elevation of man than the outlines of the world: these were the thoughts and hopes uppermost in the minds of the founders of the Alpha Tau Omega Fraternity.

While drag is a performing art, it is also a form of self-expression and a celebration of
LGBTQ+ pride. Today, drag has become a creative outlet for queer identifying people to achieve gender expression, self-empowerment, artistic exploration, community building, and fighting discrimination.
The art of drag incorporates acting, dancing, fashion, comedy, and make-up skills. Drag performances established the queer culture in society with a huge motive of fighting against all the odds to set the normality and equality of queer orientations in the society. Drag displays that gender identities are equal, fluid, and devoid of labels--a message that urgently needs to be heard in today’s world.

Our Mission is to (1) Communicate – create an atmosphere where graduate students and post-docs can connect, generate ideas, and share advice with fellow scientists; (2) Educate – learn about the problems caused by the disparity of success in STEM, especially chemistry and physics and astronomy, as well as the inspirational work done by minority scientists throughout history; (3) Articulate – discuss ways to solve these problems and encourage departments to be more welcoming of all scientists. 
We provide support for graduate students and post docs in the chemistry and physics and astronomy departments to create a more welcoming community for all members of STEM departments at UNC. We do this by inviting speakers from diverse backgrounds to speak to the community twice a year. We run a graduate peer-mentoring program (Graduate Achievement through Mentorship) to provide first-year graduate students the support they need. 
We meet every other month to discuss new and ongoing policy projects, initiatives and events within the departments. If you are interested in learning more, check out our website, or use your UNC email account to join our listserv!

Mission Statement:
Carolina Review is a journal of conservative thought and opinion published at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, founded by a group of graduate and undergraduate students in 1993. Carolina Review has been the most visible and consistent voice of conservatism on campus, providing students with an alternative to the left-wing orthodoxy promoted by other student publications, professors, and student groups. During its ten-year existence, the Review has enabled UNC students to hear both sides of issues, while combining reporting with opinion, humor, and feature articles.
Carolina Review is staffed solely by UNC students who write and publish on a monthly basis. Our purpose is to show students that a political philosophy of conservatism, free thought, and individual liberty is an intelligent way of looking at the world–contrary to what they may hear in the classrooms and on campus. In general, writers and contributors to the Review share a belief in the following:
We believe the University should be a forum for rational and informed debate–instead of the current climate in which ideological dogma, political correctness, fashion, and mob mentality suppress academic freedom.
We believe any attempt to establish utopia is bound to meet with failure and, more often than not, disaster.
We believe free enterprise and economic growth, especially at the local level, provide the basis for a sound society.
We believe the University is an important battleground in the “war of ideas” and the outcomes of political battles of the future are, to a great degree, being determined on campuses today.
We believe a code of honor, integrity and rationality are the fundamental characteristics of individual success. There is no excuse for lack of individual initiative.
We emphatically oppose totalitarianism and its apologists.

The organization accomplishes its mission by offering resources, guidance, and organization to student filmmakers to realize their vision in a cinematic language over televisual or episodic forms.
We use a fluid structure to develop and produce several projects at once while pushing students to elevate their art. The different guilds collaborate on different projects, playing on each member's different strengths and interests to produce great films. 
Formed from a simple idea, CFA has grown to over 200 undergraduates from a number of academic disciplines. Similarly organized like many production companies, CFA is built upon an Officer Board, a Board of Executive Producers, and multiple Department Guilds (Screenwriting, Editing, Acting, etc.).
Ideas, pitches, and scripts of any nature are welcomed by all, from its members or any UNC student. After a thorough feasibility assessment, greenlighted productions are assigned a producer and/or director. These individuals then build a production crew consisting of actors, editors, cinematographers, and set crew. Across the next couple of weeks, these members work hard to develop a quality piece of work suitable for a multitude of audiences.

We publish one magazine per semester, with about 25-30 articles highlighting ongoing research at UNC-Chapel Hill. This research ranges in discipline, from Biology and Chemistry to Environmental Science and Anthropology. Readers of our magazine have the opportunity to explore their scientific interests and potential projects and labs that they could get involved in. We hope to improve scientific literary for all and inspire innovation and creativity for future STEM leaders! 
We recruit staff writers, designers, and copy editors during the first two to three weeks of each semester to work on that semester's publication. We have interest meetings and workshops for each team. Staff writers will learn how to interview professors and write articles for a science writing magazine. They will also be given information about how to become involved with undergraduate research. Designers learn how to layout and organize a magazine using InDesign. Copy editors get to hone in on their editing skills by editing the articles from the Staff Writers. Our Executive Board oversees content editing, finances, and team leadership.

Our motto is: ""HeART yourself, HEEL others""
ArtHeels is a service-based organization that is passionate about bringing art to the UNC campus and the surrounding community. We believe in the principles of art therapy, which as defined by the American Art Therapy Association, are “…the creative process, and the resulting artwork to explore…feelings, reconcile emotional conflicts, foster self-awareness, manage behavior and addictions, develop social skills, improve reality orientation, reduce anxiety, and increase self-esteem. A goal in art therapy is to improve or restore a client’s functioning and his or her sense of personal well-being” (AATA 2013). Thus, though none of our club members are licensed therapists, we recognize the ability of art to promote expression and well-being in a variety of settings, and we serve to bring these powers of art to Chapel Hill.
ArtHeels works to accomplish this arts-based healing through audience-specific art projects. We work with all age groups, and for each group we aim to promote wellness through art projects that are geared toward their specific needs. By doing story-based drawings with kids, which supports creativity and self-awareness, or making clay creations with elder participants, which can increase both group processing and motor function (NCBI 1996), we are able to encourage a range of healthy expression that is catered to the range of our community partners' needs.
Most recently we have had committed volunteer partnerships with Communiversity and the Pediatric Playroom in UNC hospital. We try to offer as many volunteer opportunities as possible throughout the semester!
In addition to serving our community, we are also dedicated to serving the UNC campus. Every year, we hold at least one “stress-relief” event during finals. You may have even seen us in the pit before putting on our well-known Messy Twister event! By hosting fun art activities during high-stress times, we hope to promote self-care among students as well as a space for healthy expression on campus. Other campus activities that we have hosted in the past include dance meditation, “Splatter you stress away,” and “painting with paws.”    
In addition to serving Chapel Hill, we also host two general body meetings a month. At these meetings, we do everything from making Valentines for children in the hospital to presenting information on pursuing an Art therapy degree. It is highly recommended that volunteers attend these meetings, because those who attend are given priority in the volunteer sign-up process. The general body meeting dates will be posted on our Facebook page as well as sent out to our listserv each semester. We will also aim to post them on our student life page every semester as well.
If doing art while serving the community is something you are interested in, then please consider joining ArtHeels! We welcome anyone who is a UNC undergraduate or graduate student to join. And please note, NO ART EXPERIENCE IS REQUIRED! Being a volunteer with ArtHeels is about the experience you are able to share with the participants, it is not about being an incredible artist—though incredible artists are very welcome to join ArtHeels, too!

Active Minds at Carolina is the UNC-Chapel Hill chapter of Active Minds. Our projects increase students’ awareness of mental health conditions, provide information and resources regarding mental health and mental illness, encourage students to have conversations regarding their mental health, and serve as a liaison between students and the mental health community.

Through campus-wide events, collaborations, and national programs, Active Minds at Carolina aims to fight against the stigma that surrounds mental health issues. We work to create a comfortable environment for open conversations on mental health to take place on the UNC-Chapel Hill campus.

  The essence of Judo is captured in its English translation -- the “gentle way”. The sport of Judo is a delicate balance between an art form and a form of combat. Balance is an integral part of Judo’s ultimate goal: the perfection of human character through harmony. Judo, then, is more than just a sport, it is a way of life. Each student is a teacher and each teacher a student. Carolina Judo exists to give members the opportunity to strive towards the highest levels of Judo, both mentally and physically, in an atmosphere of friendship and mutual respect.  Many people also find the practice of Judo to be beneficial to development of self defense techniques.
  Our club promotes the study and practice of Kodokan Judo for recreational and competitive purposes. The Judo club will hold regular practices and participate in sanctioned judo competitions. Regular opportunities for promotion will be offered as well. We are open to new members at any time of the year and no prior experience is required to join.

BPSS challenges participants to expand their understanding of service, connect academic and community-based experiences and build their capacity to help effect change. While completing the program components, participants build portfolios reflecting their learning and unique experiences throughout North Carolina, the nation and the world.
Since 2003, BPSS has connected students with similar interests and provided special opportunities for leadership development and community engagement.
Program goals
BPSS strengthens the culture of service and engagement at UNC-Chapel Hill by:
Challenging students to increase the breadth and depth of their involvement in North Carolina communities and beyond
Fostering connections between the University, its students and the community
Promoting student participation in varying dimensions of public service: direct, organizational and policy
Developing students’ capacity for engaging in their communities in meaningful ways
To achieve this, BPSS involves a number of required program components and also a variety of non-required opportunities available to BPSS participants.
Buckley Portfolio
Throughout their time in BPSS, students build a Buckley Portfolio that tracks their progress in completing the program components and their own public service goals. This is where they enter and organize information such as the service hours they have completed, service-learning courses they have taken and skills trainings they have attended. Participants are able to print a summary of their Buckley Portfolio at any point throughout their participation in the program and also as they graduate.
For questions about the Buckley Portfolio, contact BPSS.

We are excited that your passion for community service and engagement has brought you to us.
  To apply for the Bonner Leaders Program, sign in to Heel Life to access the form on the bottom of this page! Applications are now live and will be reviewed on a rolling basis now through August 28th, 2023! At this time only incoming first-year and transfer students with at least 3 years of expected enrollment at Carolina are eligible to apply.
  The Bonner Leaders Program is committed to developing student leaders while exploring social justice, civic engagement, community building, diversity, international perspectives, and personal beliefs. Our program is housed within the Campus Y, a department within the Division of Student Affairs. The Campus Y is a collaborative space that unites students, staff, faculty, and community partners in the pursuit of social justice.
  Bonner Leaders receive financial support through the Federal Work-Study program for their community service, training, and enrichment activities. For this reason, all candidates for the Bonner Leaders Program must demonstrate Work-Study eligibility and funding as determined by the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), and have a total award of $3,000 or more per academic year.
  Joining the Bonner Leaders Program means a college-long commitment to an internship with a local community organization for approximately 6-8 hours per week, and mandatory Monday night meetings from 6pm-8pm for training and enrichment activities. This adds up to ~10 hours per week, for nearly 300 hours of service per year! 
  There are other Cornerstone experiences that you are expected to participate in throughout your time in the program, including the All-Bonner Retreat, First-Year Experience, Sophomore Exchange, Junior Retreat, and Senior Presentations of Learning.
  There are many additional opportunities for you to take advantage of through this program, in order to deepen your educational and professional experiences, such as: serving as a member of the Bonner Leadership Team, becoming a National Bonner Congress Representative, attending National Leadership conferences, serving as a program intern, and applying for local and international summer internship funding and opportunities.

  Our organization's goal is to help students identify the best ways of helping animals through education and facilitating connections with professionals both in the animal advocacy space and in the alternative proteins industry. We also want to create a safe space where animal advocates, vegans, and vegetarians can make friends and collaborate on projects together.
  In addition to social events, a core part of our programming is the Animal Ethics Fellowship in which members are split into groups and a facilitator guides them through a curriculum over the course of 5–8 weeks. The curriculum covers topics such as moral circle expansion, veganism, animal advocacy as a social justice issue, the pros and cons of the field of ""effective animal advocacy,"" invertebrate welfare, and wild animal welfare.
  It's not required to be an ""animal lover"" to be a part of our group. (Although, if you are an animal lover, we'd be more than happy to have you. 😄) We think that the moral arguments for ending oppression and suffering, wherever they occur, shouldn't be arbitrarily restricted to members of our own species, and you don't have to be someone who enjoys the company of animals or someone who is fascinated by animals to be an advocate for them. We accept anyone into our organization regardless of gender, race, ethnicity, nationality, ability, background, and personal dietary choices.

There is no experience required to join and practices are initially geared towards beginners. Instructors will incorporate more techniques as club members improve and there will be designated practices and times for rolling/sparring. Members will have opportunities to test their skills and compete in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu tournaments. However, no member is ever required to roll, spar, or compete if they don’t want to.

The purpose of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc. is to cultivate and encourage high scholastic and ethical standards, to promote unity and friendship among college women, to study and help alleviate problems concerning girls and women in order to improve their social stature, to maintain a progressive interest in college life, and to be of service all mankind. 
The Epsilon Delta Chapter became the First Black Sorority on the University of Wisconsin-Madison campus, as well as the first Undergraduate chapter of Alpha Kappa Alpha in the state. Given the small number of Black students enrolled at the University of Wisconsin-Madison on Saturday May 18, 1968, the presence of a Black sorority on this campus made a very important statement. 
The Epsilon Delta Chapter was and still is involved in promoting Black unity and Black heritage on campus, as well as providing service to the University Wisconsin-Madison and Madison communities. Through our programming and service initiatives, this powerful legacy of ‘Being of Service to all Mankind’ proudly continues today, and we continue to do it with ‘Style and Grace’

As a University of Wisconsin–Madison Registered Student Organization, we seek to provide the student body with educational resources regarding facts about mental health and suicide as well as advertise resources available on campus to help those in need. 
A primary service provided by AFSP-UW is the educational workshops delivered to groups on campus. Workshops come from the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention and educate our community on talking to peers about mental health, how to act in a crisis and how to seek resources. We further promote and explain all resources available to students on campus, both professional (UHS) and peer, as well as national resources provided by the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention. These workshops are available to any group upon request.
We strive to make ourselves involved in the UW Madison community, hoping our presence will help educate the student body, thus eliminating the stigma surrounding mental health and suicide. The de-stigmatization of mental illness and suicide allows students in need of help feel safe to seek the help they need, free of any ridicule or judgment. Throughout the academic year, we provide monthly social events, including documentary showings, comedy shows, bonfires, speakers, etc. to get the student body involved. Furthermore, our annual suicide prevention walk, Out of the Darkness Madison Campus Walk, sponsored by the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, provides hundreds of people from all over to join for a day of performances, stories, communal interaction, and a way to promote the suicide prevention movement.
All in all, AFSP-UW is here to make sure no one ever feels alone or ashamed because of their mental state. We hope that by educating our student body about suicide and mental illness, we can create a safe, welcoming, mentally friendly campus that supports and helps those in need. We are here to ASK if others are okay, LISTEN to what they have to say, and guide them to the appropriate professional resources to, hopefully SAVE a life.

The American Medical Women’s Association empowers women to lead in improving health for all within a model that reflects the unique perspective of women.
MISSION
The American Medical Women’s Association is an organization which functions at the local, national, and international level to advance women in medicine and improve women’s health.  We achieve this by providing and developing leadership, advocacy, education, expertise, mentoring, and strategic alliances.
BACKGROUND
The American Medical Women’s Association (AMWA) is an organization of women physicians, medical students and other persons dedicated to serving as the unique voice for women’s health and the advancement of women in medicine. The organization was founded by Dr. Bertha VanHoosen in 1915 in Chicago, at a time when women physicians were an under-represented minority. As women in medicine increase in numbers, new obstacles arise that were not anticipated. AMWA has been addressing these issues for 95 years.

PREMEDICAL BRANCH AT UW MADISON
Founded in 2017, this Premedical Branch of the American Medical Women's Association aims to encourage women in healthcare into leadership roles while fostering a safe space for a successful career in health.

The most obvious and immediate is the unique opportunity for a practical leadership experience while learning to work harmoniously within a group. Over a longer horizon, there is the joy of lifelong friendships with men who hold similar aims and ideals. Many of these friendships span age differences. Undergraduate Brothers often receive their first introduction to a profession or a business career through successful alumni who have had similar experiences. And later on, interested alumni may also foster leadership qualities in the next generation through their participation in chapter advisory boards and in regional activities.
Alpha Delta Phi was founded in 1832 at Hamilton College in Clinton, New York by Samuel Eells (1810-1842).  Founded as a literary society, it evolved into one of the most distinguished of the original American college fraternities.  It has retained its focus on its literary roots, by attracting only the best students at only the best colleges and universities in Canada and the United States.  Our chapters are leaders on their respective campuses, where some of our chapter houses have been designated architectural or historic landmarks.  The Alpha Delta Phi experience has helped a disproportionate number of its 50,000 lifelong members to become top leaders in industry, government, education, and religion.
Samuel Eells, the provident founder of The Alpha Delta Phi, most eloquently expressed the principal purpose of the fraternity. It was his intent that “this new association, with a true philosophical spirit, looking to the entire man, develop his whole being—moral, social and intellectual.” Since its beginning at Hamilton College in 1832, The Alpha Delta Phi has sought to provide a comprehensive growth experience for young men at leading universities and colleges in Canada and the United States.
As lifelong members of a fraternal brotherhood, Brothers unite to participate in an atmosphere of energetic and concerted interaction where the moral, social and intellectual aspects of each man’s character may grow and flourish. Special importance is attached to five areas: enhancing personal self esteem; promoting constructive respect and caring for others with diverse backgrounds and personalities; developing leadership qualities and self discipline; improving scholastic and literary skills; and serving the school and community.
Fraternity involvement is characterized by undertaking responsibilities within a group of peers while at the same time having contact with interested alumni. This process enhances individual self-respect as well as fostering responsible concern for others within the chapter. The Fraternity’s tradition is to seek members from a broad spectrum of backgrounds, interests and skills. In this climate, each Brother develops an appreciation of those different from himself and comes to understand how the viewpoints of others can enrich his own life.
The formulation and pursuit of group goals requires the active and disciplined participation of all Brothers. Responsible involvement in managing the chapter programs and physical plant extends the leadership and team skills of the Brothers.
In addition to chapter-oriented activities, Brothers are encouraged to undertake projects that benefit both school and community. Along with the additional growth in group skills, each Brother comes to appreciate the personal and societal rewards associated with contributing to a larger community.
Standards of behavior and achievement are not rigidly imposed; however, excellence is strongly encouraged. Moreover, there is a strong emphasis on brotherhood and blending one’s personal interests with those of the chapter.

These seven women were searching for a group of young women that would contribute to the growth of its members emotionally, intellectually and socially. We are a sorority that strives to inspire and support exemplary women dedicated to friendship and a lifelong commitment to sisterhood, while building on the vision of our founders. We prize individuality, encouraging each member to discover and develop the talents and abilities that make her unique. But just as we value individuality, we also prize togetherness, fostering friendships and a sense of belonging. When becoming a part of AEPhi, you are not just becoming a member of a sorority; you are becoming a sister in a family, full of love, trust and understanding that lasts a lifetime.
Alpha Epsilon Phi has two national philanthropies. Sharsheret is a national nonprofit organization of cancer survivors dedicated to addressing the unique challenges young women living with breast cancer deal with on a day to day basis. Elizabeth Glazer Pediatrics AIDS Foundation, our second national philanthropy, is one of the leading pediatric AIDS organizations. Elizabeth was a member of AEPhi Sigma Chapter, and while giving birth to her first child, she was transfused with blood that was infected with the AIDS virus, which she unknowingly passed along to her two children. The Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation is a nonprofit organization dedicated to preventing pediatric HIV infection and eliminating pediatric AIDS through research, advocacy, and prevention, care, and treatment programs.

The purpose of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc. is to cultivate and encourage high scholastic and ethical standards, to promote unity and friendship among college women, to study and help alleviate problems concerning girls and women in order to improve their social stature, to maintain a progressive interest in college life, and to be of service all mankind. 
The Epsilon Delta Chapter became the First Black Sorority on the University of Wisconsin-Madison campus, as well as the first Undergraduate chapter of Alpha Kappa Alpha in the state. Given the small number of Black students enrolled at the University of Wisconsin-Madison on Saturday May 18, 1968, the presence of a Black sorority on this campus made a very important statement. 
The Epsilon Delta Chapter was and still is involved in promoting Black unity and Black heritage on campus, as well as providing service to the University Wisconsin-Madison and Madison communities. Through our programming and service initiatives, this powerful legacy of ‘Being of Service to all Mankind’ proudly continues today, and we continue to do it with ‘Style and Grace’

These seven women were searching for a group of young women that would contribute to the growth of its members emotionally, intellectually and socially. We are a sorority that strives to inspire and support exemplary women dedicated to friendship and a lifelong commitment to sisterhood, while building on the vision of our founders. We prize individuality, encouraging each member to discover and develop the talents and abilities that make her unique. But just as we value individuality, we also prize togetherness, fostering friendships and a sense of belonging. When becoming a part of AEPhi, you are not just becoming a member of a sorority; you are becoming a sister in a family, full of love, trust and understanding that lasts a lifetime.
Alpha Epsilon Phi has two national philanthropies. Sharsheret is a national nonprofit organization of cancer survivors dedicated to addressing the unique challenges young women living with breast cancer deal with on a day to day basis. Elizabeth Glazer Pediatrics AIDS Foundation, our second national philanthropy, is one of the leading pediatric AIDS organizations. Elizabeth was a member of AEPhi Sigma Chapter, and while giving birth to her first child, she was transfused with blood that was infected with the AIDS virus, which she unknowingly passed along to her two children. The Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation is a nonprofit organization dedicated to preventing pediatric HIV infection and eliminating pediatric AIDS through research, advocacy, and prevention, care, and treatment programs.

Founded in 2016, the Business Diversity Program at UW is dedicated to ensuring the equality of UW business opportunities for small, minority, LGBTQ, service-disabled, veteran, and women‐owned businesses. This includes making efforts to ensure that the University is mindful and aware of the types of businesses that are contracted as suppliers of goods and services. Diversity within the supply chain helps strengthen the economic development and viability of small, minority and women‐owned businesses and helps the University receive quality goods and services at competitive prices from its vendors.
  Each academic school year, students are invited to join the Business Diversity Program and have a chance to make a change. This team of students from across various majors and academic focuses examines the best way to communicate to their peers of the vital role business diversity plays at the University. Commitment to the program includes attending meetings on a weekly basis, devoting several hours per week to conducting research, executing the campaign, and spreading the word about business diversity. We strive to provide students with the opportunity to have a positive impact on how the University does business.
  Mission: 
To promote the practice of buying from diverse-owned suppliers, through the education and engagement of the University of Washington community.
  Vision: 
To have a campus where all business owners are given the opportunity to conduct business on campus, while educating the UW community about the importance of business diversity. Secondly providing professional development opportunities to undergraduate students across campus.
  Goals: 
Encourage the UW community to purchase from local diverse owned businesses
Educate and provide opportunities for business owners and students to engage with the supplier diversity initiative 
Create brand awareness of the importance of local diverse owned suppliers and provide exposure for them to the UW community

Now over 175 years later Alpha Sigma Phi is one of the largest and strongest fraternities in the nation.
Silence | Charity | Purity | Honor | Patriotism
A group of students was organized by alumni of Alpha Sigma Phi living in the Seattle Area to seek a charter in Alpha Sigma Phi. On January 8, 1912, they submitted their petition for a charter. The petition was approved and the Mu chapter of Alpha Sigma Phi was installed on May 20, 1912, by Carl B. Croson, Beta ’11.
Since that time, over 110 years ago, The Mu chapter won the Grand Senior President's Cup - signifying the best Alpha Sig chapter in North America on a large campus - six times: 1980, 1982, 1984, 1986, 2018, and 2020
With the Motto, “To Better the Man”, the over 80 currently active members embody this ideal on a daily basis. With a current multi-million dollar renovation wrapping up in early 2022, one of the oldest fraternity chapter houses still standing on the UW Greek Row, The Old Gal, remains one of the strongest brotherhoods in the nation.

The Psi Chapter of Delta Lambda Phi has supported the leadership and development of all Queer (LGBT2QIA+) people and allies on campus since 2004.
  Delta Lambda Phi strives to provide a welcoming alternative to traditional Greek life on campus for Queer (LGBT2QIA+) students and allies. As a progressive fraternity, DLP - Psi Chapter works to create an open atmosphere for Queer people to meet, form strong bonds, and develop leadership skills through community service. Additionally, we invite allies to experience and learn the histories of Queer minorities to better serve as advocates when we cannot.
  The Three Purposes of Delta Lambda Phi
To develop dignified and purposeful social, service, and recreational activities for all, irrespective of gender identity or sexual orientation.
The Founder of Delta Lambda Phi wished to create a place within the fraternal system for gay and progressive men to have the same experience as other men without being singled out for their sexual orientation. Today, we recognize the diversity of sexual and gender identities and welcome all to learn the Lambda Way. Delta Lambda Phi never condones hazing; as such, all of our events seek to show our values and participate as upstanding community members in a safe, comfortable environment. 
To lead in determining the rights and privileges of individuals in society.
This principle goes hand in hand with making our presence known and being a friend to all. Sometimes we, as members of Delta Lambda Phi, must stand up for those around us who can’t speak for themselves. We demonstrate this by ensuring everyone is treated equally and fighting discrimination in all forms, whether on campus, locally, or across the nation. 
To present a strong and positive image which respects the diversity of all.
As members of Delta Lambda Phi, we strive to educate people about cultures, ideologies, and principles they may not otherwise experience. We promote positive images that combat stereotypes, promote diversity in our lives, and fight all forms of discrimination.

Our goals are to provide the band not only with organized and concentrated service activities, but to give our membership valid and wholesome experiences in organization, leadership and social contacts. The honorary nature of membership is based on our premise that “it is an honor to be selected to serve” this band, its department of music, its sponsoring institution, and the cause of band music in the nation’s colleges and universities.
       The Fraternity is presently located in over 150 colleges and universities. Since 1919 more than 50,000 interested bandmembers have devoted their efforts to strengthening their bands through group and individual service projects. The Fraternity’s program of continued service to Music has attracted the attention of the best in American band tradition. We number among our ranks John Philip Sousa, Karl King, Frank Simon, Herbert L. Clarke, Harold Bachman, William D. Revelli and many other contemporary composers, conductors and music educators.
       Be it known that Kappa Kappa Psi, National Honorary Fraternity for College Bandmembers, is an organization operating exclusively in the field of the college and university bands, and for the following several purposes:
1. To promote the existence and welfare of the college and university bands and to cultivate at large a wholesome respect for their activities and achievements.
2. To honor outstanding bandmembers through privilege of membership extended as a reward for technical achievement and appreciation for the best in music.
3. To stimulate campus leadership and promulgate an uncompromising respect through the medium of the college band for gracious conduct, good taste and unswerving loyalty.
4. To foster a close relationship between college bands and promote a high average of attainment by the performance of good music and selection of worthwhile projects.
5. To provide a pleasant and helpful social experience for all engaged in college band work and to cooperate with other musical organizations in any manner consistent with the purposes of the institution at which chapters are located.

Best Buddies International is an international nonprofit dedicated to establishing a global movement that creates opportunities for one-to-one friendships, integrated employment, leadership development, and inclusive living for individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD).
Who we serve:
The IDD community that Best Buddies serves include, but is not limited to, people with Down Syndrome, autism, Fragile X, Williams syndrom, traumatic brain injurty and other undiagnosed disabilities.
Programs:
Best Buddies is the world's largest organization dedicated to ending the social, physical and economic isolation of the 200 million people with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD). Our programs empower the special abilities of people with IDD by helping them form meaningful friendships with their peers, secure successful jobs, live independently, improve public speaking, self-advocacy and communication skills, and feel valued by society. Join the UW chapter today, and help to make a difference here in your community!
Levels of Involvement
There are two levels of involvement in UW Best Buddies: peer buddy or associate member. As a peer buddy, you are matched in a one-to-one friendship with an adult in the community with IDD. You are responsible for attending bi-weekly meetings and hanging out with your buddy at least once a month, as well as making regular contact with your buddy via text, phone call, etc. 
For students that would still like to be involved in Best Buddies but cannot commit to being matched in a one-to-one friendship, an associate member is the commitment level for them!  There are no requirements for being an associate member; students may come to meetings and socialize as they wish. We will meet you at any commitment level!
If you have any questions about getting involved with Best Buddies at the University of Washington, email uwashingtonbestbuddies@gmail.com
We ask that rather than fill out an application on the RSO website that you send us an email to ensure that we can get you involved with our club in whatever capacity you would like. We are happy to answer any and all of your questions!

Please contact us through our facebook page for best results!
FAQ's for the Brazilian Jiu Jitsu Club at the University of Washington
Q: When does the club practice?
A: We train Mondays and Wednesdays during the UW academic year from 8:45pm to 10:30pm in Mat Room B in the IMA. The beginner class trains concurrently with club practices, from 8:45pm to 9:30pm.
Q: Are there any dues or requirements I need to complete in order to join the club?
A: If you have a valid IMA membership and prior experience training Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, you have everything you need to join our club practice! We only ask that you introduce yourself to our coach at a practice before you begin practicing so he knows your comfortability level and what level of experience you bring. In some cases we may also ask you to take our beginner class or complete further training before joining the club practices.
Q: I have no experience training Brazilian Jiu Jitsu but I'm interested, is that okay?
A: Most of our members didn't have any experience prior to training with us, and we are a beginner focused club and class. We offer a beginner class through the IMA for that reason, and through the class you will learn the fundamentals and basic safety skills necessary to see what BJJ is about, whether or not it's the sport for you, and the skills to join the club practices.
Q: How can I sign up for the beginner class?
A: To sign up for the class, you can go this link (https://reg.recreation.uw.edu/) and select special interest classes. There you will see an option for Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and after selecting that you can begin the registration process. Once you have completed the class, you should have all the experience you need to continue into the club practices. If the class is full, you can wait to sign up for the next quarter and the exact same material will be taught.
Q: When do the classes and club practices start?
A: Classes start on the Monday of the third week of the quarter, and club practices begin on the Monday of the first week of the quarter.
If you have any other questions absolutely feel free to message our page and one of our officers can get back to you!

  Once you join the club you get access to all the trips we lead as well as our free gear library. It's an amazing deal!

Biochemistry Undergraduate Reading Program",https://huskylink.washington.edu/organization/burp,,"The Biochemistry Undergraduate Reading Program (BURP) creates 1-on-1 mentorship experiences between undergraduate mentees and a graduate or postdoctoral mentor, as well as cohort-wide learning experiences between undergraduates. Mentees are paired with mentors based on shared interests, and the pair meets throughout the academic term to read and discuss scientific papers. In addition, undergraduate students may meet in a journal club to discuss with each other their papers and questions they have. The quarter culminates in a symposium where mentees demonstrate what they have learned to the UW Biochemistry community.
BURP was created to empower undergraduate students to hone their critical thinking skills by reading the biochemical scientific literature, and to develop their skills pertaining to this mission, such as citation management, knowledge management, and paper analysis tools while reading scientific literature in two settings: (i) in partnership with a mentor (graduate student, postdoctoral scholar, or faculty member) through 1-on-1 meetings; and (ii) in community with other undergraduate students through an informal journal club / journal workshop. Through this process, we aim to form meaningful mentor relationships between undergraduate and graduate students, and assist graduate students with an opportunity to practice and improve mentorship and teaching skills.

  1. To bind its members with a tie of true and lasting friendship.
  2. To strive for the advancement of Chemistry both as a science and as a profession.
  3. To aid its members by every honorable means in the attainment in their ambitions as chemists throughout their mortal lives.
  There is no organization quite comparable to a professional fraternity. Socially, it presents members with the opportunity of meeting those interested in their work. Fraternal bonds are ever so much stronger than professional ones, but there are no bonds as strong as those created through combined fraternal and professional interests. Members of Alpha Chi Sigma, many of whom are leaders in the industrial and scientific world, all share common fraternal ideals. Purely professional organizations such as the American Chemical Society and the American Institute of Chemical Engineers have their place, and Alpha Chi Sigma constantly encourages its members to become active in these organizations. Social fraternities also offer much to the student, but only a professional fraternity—and Alpha Chi Sigma is the only national professional chemistry fraternity in the United States--can provide the college student and the professional in chemistry and related fields with the interests and bonds of a fraternity.
All chapter-sanctioned events for the Fall 2022 and Spring 2023 semesters will be held in accordance with both university and state public health guidelines.
We perform rush events at the beginning of both the Fall and Spring semesters. These events introduce prospective members to the organization, and what would be required of them as a pledge of Alpha Chi Sigma. The pledging process will last about 2 months and will consist of pledge bonding activities, education about the fraternity, and participation in Alpha Chi Sigma's professional and philanthropic activities. 
Undergraduate pledges are no longer required to achieve a minimum amount of credit hours in the Chemical sciences and are only requested to have a passion for Chemistry. Our most common majors are Chemistry, Chemical Engineering, Biochemistry, and Biology, but Biological Systems Engineering, Environmental Science and some Agribusiness, Animal and Poultry Science, Crop and Soil Environmental Science, Dairy Science, Food Science and Technology, Human Nutrition, Foods and Exercise and Wood Science majors can also join, as well as anyone with a Chemistry minor. See the documents page for a full list of required options for these majors. We cannot pledge first semester freshmen or graduating seniors. 
Graduate students, faculty members, and members of the community may pledge if in a field where chemistry predominates. Pledging requirements are much less time-intensive for professional pledges. There are currently 13 graduate student and 15 faculty member brothers, and there is a Southwest Virginia Professional Group.

Along with our competition season, ACO-VT strives to make Quizbowl more accessible at both the high school and collegiate level and to have fun!

What is Quizbowl?
Quizbowl, Scholastic Bowl, ACE, etc. is a team-based academic competition. We like to explain it as ""team-orientated"" Jeopardy (we also use buzzer systems similar to Jeopardy). If you enjoy trivia, it is definitely for you! 

Practice Schedule
ACO practices every Monday and Thursday from 5:00 - 8:00 PM. For 2023, almost all Monday practices will be in Squires 145 and almost all Thursday practices will be in Squires 147. Members will be emailed a reminder with the location of practice the day of. Practice is not mandatory and is open to the public! If you can only make part of that time, we recommend that you come in for however long you can and hear some questions.

What does the team do?
The main activity ACO members participate in is attending competitions. We generally compete at 4-6 tournaments ranging from collegiate novice to ACF Regionals. These tournaments are all paid for by the club, and transportation and hotels are also covered by the club.  Along with tournaments, we host high school and college tournaments, which ACO members staff. To help build Quizbowl within the local area, ACO sends staffers to nearby local tournaments and help run practices and matches for Montgomery County and nearby colleges.

How do I join?
Come to practice or contact us! There are no auditions or tryouts. We take any Virginia Tech students (including graduate students). In order to be added to the email list that includes sign-ups for competitions and practice locations, you must  attend a practice. This helps us keep the roster number an accurate representative of our active members

We accept people as they are and help those find their unique expression by creating a safe space where confidence could flourish to further increase leadership in certain different settings. Leadership is built on confidence, and we believe that we can support students to speak up for themselves and for others.
Additionally, spreading awareness of mental health on campus is another goal we have. Many people have different mental health issues, but don’t know how to cope in healthy ways. Due to this, we will also have professional guest speakers to give mental health advice and knowledge that will be applicable in everyday life. Our club will also create a safe space for people to address their concerns in life without judgment and spread awareness of resources, provided by VT and nationwide. We will be supporting those who want to create a different lifestyle or aesthetic, that our members believe would make them more comfortable in their skin, to the best of our organization’s ability. 
Empowerment Leadership Association focuses on self-care, physically and mentally, including mental health, body positivity, diligence, and mindfulness. As much as self-empowerment is important, we believe that encompassing our communities through service is equally essential to our club’s purpose.

Strong Individuals Striving Together As Sisters (SISTAS) was established by co-founders Tina Park and Alice Vuong with the intention of laying the foundation for a chapter of the sorority on campus. Following their belief that the sorority would provide Asian American women with a support system not otherwise found on campus, the ladies of SISTAS worked persistently to become a group that would acquire the respect and interest from the Virginia Tech campus, surrounding community of Blacksburg, and the existing chapters of alpha Kappa Delta Phi.
          Joined by Kokoro Fujiyama, Marylynn Jansak, Nicole Shin, Erica Sok, Carol Tsai, Hannah Xiu, and Melody Yok; the 9 women worked together to lay the foundation of friendship and sisterhood. Through their dedicated efforts, the ladies of SISTAS impacted the community with their message of Asian Awareness, sisterhood and charity. In the Spring of 2002, the sisters of the Theta Chapter of alpha Kappa Delta Phi at the University of Pennsylvania, the first full-fledged chapter on the East Coast, was granted the privilege of hosting the pledging colony of Virginia Tech. After almost a year of work in addition to the continued support of their host chapter, UPenn, and pledge mom, Margaret Shea, the ladies at Virginia Tech were able to realize their own potential and abilities while reaching their long-held goals.
          On April 14, 2002, the ladies of SISTAS proudly became the 32nd chapter of the nation’s largest and most prestigious Asian American sorority, alpha Kappa Delta Phi. Now loving and devoted sisters of alpha Kappa Delta Phi, the Virginia Tech Colony Chapter continues to grow as individuals and as sisters, through love and everlasting friendship💜

Along with our competition season, ACO-VT strives to make Quizbowl more accessible at both the high school and collegiate level and to have fun!

What is Quizbowl?
Quizbowl, Scholastic Bowl, ACE, etc. is a team-based academic competition. We like to explain it as ""team-orientated"" Jeopardy (we also use buzzer systems similar to Jeopardy). If you enjoy trivia, it is definitely for you! 

Practice Schedule
ACO practices every Monday and Thursday from 5:00 - 8:00 PM. For 2023, almost all Monday practices will be in Squires 145 and almost all Thursday practices will be in Squires 147. Members will be emailed a reminder with the location of practice the day of. Practice is not mandatory and is open to the public! If you can only make part of that time, we recommend that you come in for however long you can and hear some questions.

What does the team do?
The main activity ACO members participate in is attending competitions. We generally compete at 4-6 tournaments ranging from collegiate novice to ACF Regionals. These tournaments are all paid for by the club, and transportation and hotels are also covered by the club.  Along with tournaments, we host high school and college tournaments, which ACO members staff. To help build Quizbowl within the local area, ACO sends staffers to nearby local tournaments and help run practices and matches for Montgomery County and nearby colleges.

How do I join?
Come to practice or contact us! There are no auditions or tryouts. We take any Virginia Tech students (including graduate students). In order to be added to the email list that includes sign-ups for competitions and practice locations, you must  attend a practice. This helps us keep the roster number an accurate representative of our active members

We are not a denomination, but like-minded in doctrine and style. We are friends who support and encourage each other, start new churches, and follow Jesus together. At the core of our beliefs is the good news of Jesus Christ—the wonderful truth that Jesus Christ was crucified and raised from the dead so that sinful people would trust in Jesus and be reconciled to God.

We accept people as they are and help those find their unique expression by creating a safe space where confidence could flourish to further increase leadership in certain different settings. Leadership is built on confidence, and we believe that we can support students to speak up for themselves and for others.
Additionally, spreading awareness of mental health on campus is another goal we have. Many people have different mental health issues, but don’t know how to cope in healthy ways. Due to this, we will also have professional guest speakers to give mental health advice and knowledge that will be applicable in everyday life. Our club will also create a safe space for people to address their concerns in life without judgment and spread awareness of resources, provided by VT and nationwide. We will be supporting those who want to create a different lifestyle or aesthetic, that our members believe would make them more comfortable in their skin, to the best of our organization’s ability. 
Empowerment Leadership Association focuses on self-care, physically and mentally, including mental health, body positivity, diligence, and mindfulness. As much as self-empowerment is important, we believe that encompassing our communities through service is equally essential to our club’s purpose.

Along with our competition season, ACO-VT strives to make Quizbowl more accessible at both the high school and collegiate level and to have fun!

What is Quizbowl?
Quizbowl, Scholastic Bowl, ACE, etc. is a team-based academic competition. We like to explain it as ""team-orientated"" Jeopardy (we also use buzzer systems similar to Jeopardy). If you enjoy trivia, it is definitely for you! 

Practice Schedule
ACO practices every Monday and Thursday from 5:00 - 8:00 PM. For 2023, almost all Monday practices will be in Squires 145 and almost all Thursday practices will be in Squires 147. Members will be emailed a reminder with the location of practice the day of. Practice is not mandatory and is open to the public! If you can only make part of that time, we recommend that you come in for however long you can and hear some questions.

What does the team do?
The main activity ACO members participate in is attending competitions. We generally compete at 4-6 tournaments ranging from collegiate novice to ACF Regionals. These tournaments are all paid for by the club, and transportation and hotels are also covered by the club.  Along with tournaments, we host high school and college tournaments, which ACO members staff. To help build Quizbowl within the local area, ACO sends staffers to nearby local tournaments and help run practices and matches for Montgomery County and nearby colleges.

How do I join?
Come to practice or contact us! There are no auditions or tryouts. We take any Virginia Tech students (including graduate students). In order to be added to the email list that includes sign-ups for competitions and practice locations, you must  attend a practice. This helps us keep the roster number an accurate representative of our active members

Strong Individuals Striving Together As Sisters (SISTAS) was established by co-founders Tina Park and Alice Vuong with the intention of laying the foundation for a chapter of the sorority on campus. Following their belief that the sorority would provide Asian American women with a support system not otherwise found on campus, the ladies of SISTAS worked persistently to become a group that would acquire the respect and interest from the Virginia Tech campus, surrounding community of Blacksburg, and the existing chapters of alpha Kappa Delta Phi.
          Joined by Kokoro Fujiyama, Marylynn Jansak, Nicole Shin, Erica Sok, Carol Tsai, Hannah Xiu, and Melody Yok; the 9 women worked together to lay the foundation of friendship and sisterhood. Through their dedicated efforts, the ladies of SISTAS impacted the community with their message of Asian Awareness, sisterhood and charity. In the Spring of 2002, the sisters of the Theta Chapter of alpha Kappa Delta Phi at the University of Pennsylvania, the first full-fledged chapter on the East Coast, was granted the privilege of hosting the pledging colony of Virginia Tech. After almost a year of work in addition to the continued support of their host chapter, UPenn, and pledge mom, Margaret Shea, the ladies at Virginia Tech were able to realize their own potential and abilities while reaching their long-held goals.
          On April 14, 2002, the ladies of SISTAS proudly became the 32nd chapter of the nation’s largest and most prestigious Asian American sorority, alpha Kappa Delta Phi. Now loving and devoted sisters of alpha Kappa Delta Phi, the Virginia Tech Colony Chapter continues to grow as individuals and as sisters, through love and everlasting friendship💜

We are not a denomination, but like-minded in doctrine and style. We are friends who support and encourage each other, start new churches, and follow Jesus together. At the core of our beliefs is the good news of Jesus Christ—the wonderful truth that Jesus Christ was crucified and raised from the dead so that sinful people would trust in Jesus and be reconciled to God. This gospel is our primary passion and the driving influence in preaching, worship, small groups, prayer, and church planting.

We will be supporting those who want to create a different lifestyle or aesthetic, that our members believe would make them more comfortable in their skin, to the best of our organization’s ability. 
Empowerment Leadership Association focuses on self-care, physically and mentally, including mental health, body positivity, diligence, and mindfulness. As much as self-empowerment is important, we believe that encompassing our communities through service is equally essential to our club’s purpose.

Strong Individuals Striving Together As Sisters (SISTAS) was established by co-founders Tina Park and Alice Vuong with the intention of laying the foundation for a chapter of the sorority on campus. Following their belief that the sorority would provide Asian American women with a support system not otherwise found on campus, the ladies of SISTAS worked persistently to become a group that would acquire the respect and interest from the Virginia Tech campus, surrounding community of Blacksburg, and the existing chapters of alpha Kappa Delta Phi.
          Joined by Kokoro Fujiyama, Marylynn Jansak, Nicole Shin, Erica Sok, Carol Tsai, Hannah Xiu, and Melody Yok; the 9 women worked together to lay the foundation of friendship and sisterhood. Through their dedicated efforts, the ladies of SISTAS impacted the community with their message of Asian Awareness, sisterhood and charity. In the Spring of 2002, the sisters of the Theta Chapter of alpha Kappa Delta Phi at the University of Pennsylvania, the first full-fledged chapter on the East Coast, was granted the privilege of hosting the pledging colony of Virginia Tech. After almost a year of work in addition to the continued support of their host chapter, UPenn, and pledge mom, Margaret Shea, the ladies at Virginia Tech were able to realize their own potential and abilities while reaching their long-held goals.
          On April 14, 2002, the ladies of SISTAS proudly became the 32nd chapter of the nation’s largest and most prestigious Asian American sorority, alpha Kappa Delta Phi. Now loving and devoted sisters of alpha Kappa Delta Phi, the Virginia Tech Colony Chapter continues to grow as individuals and as sisters, through love and everlasting friendship💜

Along with our competition season, ACO-VT strives to make Quizbowl more accessible at both the high school and collegiate level and to have fun!

What is Quizbowl?
Quizbowl, Scholastic Bowl, ACE, etc. is a team-based academic competition. We like to explain it as ""team-orientated"" Jeopardy (we also use buzzer systems similar to Jeopardy). If you enjoy trivia, it is definitely for you! 

Practice Schedule
ACO practices every Monday and Thursday from 5:00 - 8:00 PM. For 2023, almost all Monday practices will be in Squires 145 and almost all Thursday practices will be in Squires 147. Members will be emailed a reminder with the location of practice the day of. Practice is not mandatory and is open to the public! If you can only make part of that time, we recommend that you come in for however long you can and hear some questions.

What does the team do?
The main activity ACO members participate in is attending competitions. We generally compete at 4-6 tournaments ranging from collegiate novice to ACF Regionals. These tournaments are all paid for by the club, and transportation and hotels are also covered by the club.  Along with tournaments, we host high school and college tournaments, which ACO members staff. To help build Quizbowl within the local area, ACO sends staffers to nearby local tournaments and help run practices and matches for Montgomery County and nearby colleges.

How do I join?
Come to practice or contact us! There are no auditions or tryouts. We take any Virginia Tech students (including graduate students). In order to be added to the email list that includes sign-ups for competitions and practice locations, you must  attend a practice. This helps us keep the roster number an accurate representative of our active members

We were established on Virginia Tech's campus in 1989 and were established nationally over 150 years ago. Our chapter was founded on a passion for intellectual development, leadership, loyalty, service, and character advancement. Each day our members strive to become better than they were the day before in and outside of the classroom by living up to not only Alpha Phi's standards but Virginia Tech's high ideals as well. We recently won the Fraternity and Sorority Life Impact Award for being the first sorority in the state of Virginia to host a commitment to ending hazing workshop for all of our members. 
Eta Omicron never has a dull moment. Whether we are participating in various philanthropies, raising thousands of dollars for cardiac care in our own philanthropy, coming together for a sisterhood event, living together, playing intramural sports, or simply going to the dining halls together, there is always something to do. Our members pride themselves in their various types of campus involvement within Alpha Phi and across many other organizations or extracurriculars. Alpha Phi encourages and endlessly supports our members when trying new things or taking on new leadership roles. 
Each member of Alpha Phi is extremely special and plays a huge role in what makes our chapter unique. We are constantly pushing ourselves to be better and do better and to leave an impact for years to come. Union hand in hand.

We are not a denomination, but like-minded in doctrine and style. We are friends who support and encourage each other, start new churches, and follow Jesus together. At the core of our beliefs is the good news of Jesus Christ—the wonderful truth that Jesus Christ was crucified and raised from the dead so that sinful people would trust in Jesus and be reconciled to God. This gospel is our primary passion and the driving influence in preaching, worship, small groups, prayer, and church planting.

In 1906 veterinary students at Ohio State University saw the benefits of fraternal life but were frustrated by the lack of a national organization for their profession. After much study and work, 22 Juniors and Seniors founded the Alpha Chapter of Alpha Psi Fraternity and by 1915 chapters had been established at 15 schools. Today, there are eleven active Alpha Psi Chapters at veterinary schools across the country.If an honor roll were established for the all time leaders of the veterinary profession in the United States, it would be heavily weighted with Alpha Psi Fraternity Members. Certainly their accomplishments are the result of individual initiative and merit but in some instances leadership and communicative skills were strengthened by their fraternity experience.
The preamble to the Alpha Psi Fraternity constitution reads as follows:
""We, students of the College of Veterinary Medicine of the Ohio State university, in order to promote a stronger bond between the veterinary colleges of the United States and Canada; to create a better feeling among the students of all veterinary colleges, and to infuse a deeper interest in the study of veterinary science, do hereby establish this constitution for the ALPHA PSI, the national veterinary fraternity.""
The constitution was written in 1907 and the objectives stated then are appropriate today. Alpha Psi is a social-professional fraternity which restricts its active membership to students who are enrolled in a school of veterinary medicine. It provides an opportunity for the development of lasting friendships between individuals in different classes or schools and is dedicated to the development of these individuals to better serve the veterinary profession.
History of Alpha Psi at the Virginia-Maryland Regional College of Veterinary Medicine
In early 1983, the Pi Chapter of Alpha Psi was founded at VMRCVM. Two individuals, Jim McDonald and Paul Howard, were instrumental in getting the chapter established. Members of the Lambda Chapter and National Officers of Alpha Psi conducted the first induction establishing 96 charter members of the Pi Chapter.

Along with our competition season, ACO-VT strives to make Quizbowl more accessible at both the high school and collegiate level and to have fun!

What is Quizbowl?
Quizbowl, Scholastic Bowl, ACE, etc. is a team-based academic competition. We like to explain it as ""team-orientated"" Jeopardy (we also use buzzer systems similar to Jeopardy). If you enjoy trivia, it is definitely for you! 

Practice Schedule
ACO practices every Monday and Thursday from 5:00 - 8:00 PM. For 2023, almost all Monday practices will be in Squires 145 and almost all Thursday practices will be in Squires 147. Members will be emailed a reminder with the location of practice the day of. Practice is not mandatory and is open to the public! If you can only make part of that time, we recommend that you come in for however long you can and hear some questions.

What does the team do?
The main activity ACO members participate in is attending competitions. We generally compete at 4-6 tournaments ranging from collegiate novice to ACF Regionals. These tournaments are all paid for by the club, and transportation and hotels are also covered by the club.  Along with tournaments, we host high school and college tournaments, which ACO members staff. To help build Quizbowl within the local area, ACO sends staffers to nearby local tournaments and help run practices and matches for Montgomery County and nearby colleges.

How do I join?
Come to practice or contact us! There are no auditions or tryouts. We take any Virginia Tech students (including graduate students). In order to be added to the email list that includes sign-ups for competitions and practice locations, you must  attend a practice. This helps us keep the roster number an accurate representative of our active members

We know college can be a busy time, but God often uses this season to direct the course of your life. Our vision is to be a church where students can find lots of friends and grow alongside one another in a challenging and meaningful way. Students are a vital part of Ascent Church. We would love to have you join us!
  We meet on Sundays at 10:00am. Our church building is located 3 minutes north of campus on Main Street across from Carol Lee's and next to Food Lion. Be sure to follow us on Instagram for updates (@ascentchurchblacksburg).
  We are part of a growing network of church-planting churches that strive to obey Jesus’ mission to make disciples in cities around the world. We are not a denomination, but like-minded in doctrine and style. We are friends who support and encourage each other, start new churches, and follow Jesus together. At the core of our beliefs is the good news of Jesus Christ—the wonderful truth that Jesus Christ was crucified and raised from the dead so that sinful people would trust in Jesus and be reconciled to God. This gospel is our primary passion and the driving influence in preaching, worship, small groups, prayer, and church planting.

Strong Individuals Striving Together As Sisters (SISTAS) was established by co-founders Tina Park and Alice Vuong with the intention of laying the foundation for a chapter of the sorority on campus. Following their belief that the sorority would provide Asian American women with a support system not otherwise found on campus, the ladies of SISTAS worked persistently to become a group that would acquire the respect and interest from the Virginia Tech campus, surrounding community of Blacksburg, and the existing chapters of alpha Kappa Delta Phi.
          Joined by Kokoro Fujiyama, Marylynn Jansak, Nicole Shin, Erica Sok, Carol Tsai, Hannah Xiu, and Melody Yok; the 9 women worked together to lay the foundation of friendship and sisterhood. Through their dedicated efforts, the ladies of SISTAS impacted the community with their message of Asian Awareness, sisterhood and charity. In the Spring of 2002, the sisters of the Theta Chapter of alpha Kappa Delta Phi at the University of Pennsylvania, the first full-fledged chapter on the East Coast, was granted the privilege of hosting the pledging colony of Virginia Tech. After almost a year of work in addition to the continued support of their host chapter, UPenn, and pledge mom, Margaret Shea, the ladies at Virginia Tech were able to realize their own potential and abilities while reaching their long-held goals.
          On April 14, 2002, the ladies of SISTAS proudly became the 32nd chapter of the nation’s largest and most prestigious Asian American sorority, alpha Kappa Delta Phi. Now loving and devoted sisters of alpha Kappa Delta Phi, the Virginia Tech Colony Chapter continues to grow as individuals and as sisters, through love and everlasting friendship💜

Anime and gaming are growing in the professional sector, and desired skills from these activities have also been proven to strengthen critical thinking. The goal is to establish Anime networks and communities of students from all academic backgrounds that have a common interest that connects them, not just for entertainment but for affinity that includes social development, mental health support, and personal growth.

We accept people as they are and help those find their unique expression by creating a safe space where confidence could flourish to further increase leadership in certain different settings. Leadership is built on confidence, and we believe that we can support students to speak up for themselves and for others.
Additionally, spreading awareness of mental health on campus is another goal we have. Many people have different mental health issues, but don’t know how to cope in healthy ways. Due to this, we will also have professional guest speakers to give mental health advice and knowledge that will be applicable in everyday life. Our club will also create a safe space for people to address their concerns in life without judgment and spread awareness of resources, provided by VT and nationwide. We will be supporting those who want to create a different lifestyle or aesthetic, that our members believe would make them more comfortable in their skin, to the best of our organization’s ability. 
Empowerment Leadership Association focuses on self-care, physically and mentally, including mental health, body positivity, diligence, and mindfulness. As much as self-empowerment is important, we believe that encompassing our communities through service is equally essential to our club’s purpose.

  1. To bind its members with a tie of true and lasting friendship.
  2. To strive for the advancement of Chemistry both as a science and as a profession.
  3. To aid its members by every honorable means in the attainment in their ambitions as chemists throughout their mortal lives.
  There is no organization quite comparable to a professional fraternity. Socially, it presents members with the opportunity of meeting those interested in their work. Fraternal bonds are ever so much stronger than professional ones, but there are no bonds as strong as those created through combined fraternal and professional interests. Members of Alpha Chi Sigma, many of whom are leaders in the industrial and scientific world, all share common fraternal ideals. Purely professional organizations such as the American Chemical Society and the American Institute of Chemical Engineers have their place, and Alpha Chi Sigma constantly encourages its members to become active in these organizations. Social fraternities also offer much to the student, but only a professional fraternity—and Alpha Chi Sigma is the only national professional chemistry fraternity in the United States--can provide the college student and the professional in chemistry and related fields with the interests and bonds of a fraternity.
All chapter-sanctioned events for the Fall 2022 and Spring 2023 semesters will be held in accordance with both university and state public health guidelines.
We perform rush events at the beginning of both the Fall and Spring semesters. These events introduce prospective members to the organization, and what would be required of them as a pledge of Alpha Chi Sigma. The pledging process will last about 2 months and will consist of pledge bonding activities, education about the fraternity, and participation in Alpha Chi Sigma's professional and philanthropic activities. 
Undergraduate pledges are no longer required to achieve a minimum amount of credit hours in the Chemical sciences and are only requested to have a passion for Chemistry. Our most common majors are Chemistry, Chemical Engineering, Biochemistry, and Biology, but Biological Systems Engineering, Environmental Science and some Agribusiness, Animal and Poultry Science, Crop and Soil Environmental Science, Dairy Science, Food Science and Technology, Human Nutrition, Foods and Exercise and Wood Science majors can also join, as well as anyone with a Chemistry minor. See the documents page for a full list of required options for these majors. We cannot pledge first semester freshmen or graduating seniors. 
Graduate students, faculty members, and members of the community may pledge if in a field where chemistry predominates. Pledging requirements are much less time-intensive for professional pledges. There are currently 13 graduate student and 15 faculty member brothers, and there is a Southwest Virginia Professional Group.

Along with our competition season, ACO-VT strives to make Quizbowl more accessible at both the high school and collegiate level and to have fun!

What is Quizbowl?
Quizbowl, Scholastic Bowl, ACE, etc. is a team-based academic competition. We like to explain it as ""team-orientated"" Jeopardy (we also use buzzer systems similar to Jeopardy). If you enjoy trivia, it is definitely for you! 

Practice Schedule
ACO practices every Monday and Thursday from 5:00 - 8:00 PM. For 2023, almost all Monday practices will be in Squires 145 and almost all Thursday practices will be in Squires 147. Members will be emailed a reminder with the location of practice the day of. Practice is not mandatory and is open to the public! If you can only make part of that time, we recommend that you come in for however long you can and hear some questions.

What does the team do?
The main activity ACO members participate in is attending competitions. We generally compete at 4-6 tournaments ranging from collegiate novice to ACF Regionals. These tournaments are all paid for by the club, and transportation and hotels are also covered by the club.  Along with tournaments, we host high school and college tournaments, which ACO members staff. To help build Quizbowl within the local area, ACO sends staffers to nearby local tournaments and help run practices and matches for Montgomery County and nearby colleges.

How do I join?
Come to practice or contact us! There are no auditions or tryouts. We take any Virginia Tech students (including graduate students). In order to be added to the email list that includes sign-ups for competitions and practice locations, you must  attend a practice. This helps us keep the roster number an accurate representative of our active members

In 1906 veterinary students at Ohio State University saw the benefits of fraternal life but were frustrated by the lack of a national organization for their profession. After much study and work, 22 Juniors and Seniors founded the Alpha Chapter of Alpha Psi Fraternity and by 1915 chapters had been established at 15 schools. Today, there are eleven active Alpha Psi Chapters at veterinary schools across the country.If an honor roll were established for the all time leaders of the veterinary profession in the United States, it would be heavily weighted with Alpha Psi Fraternity Members. Certainly their accomplishments are the result of individual initiative and merit but in some instances leadership and communicative skills were strengthened by their fraternity experience.
The preamble to the Alpha Psi Fraternity constitution reads as follows:
""We, students of the College of Veterinary Medicine of the Ohio State university, in order to promote a stronger bond between the veterinary colleges of the United States and Canada; to create a better feeling among the students of all veterinary colleges, and to infuse a deeper interest in the study of veterinary science, do hereby establish this constitution for the ALPHA PSI, the national veterinary fraternity.""
The constitution was written in 1907 and the objectives stated then are appropriate today. Alpha Psi is a social-professional fraternity which restricts its active membership to students who are enrolled in a school of veterinary medicine. It provides an opportunity for the development of lasting friendships between individuals in different classes or schools and is dedicated to the development of these individuals to better serve the veterinary profession.
History of Alpha Psi at the Virginia-Maryland Regional College of Veterinary Medicine
In early 1983, the Pi Chapter of Alpha Psi was founded at VMRCVM. Two individuals, Jim McDonald and Paul Howard, were instrumental in getting the chapter established. Members of the Lambda Chapter and National Officers of Alpha Psi conducted the first induction establishing 96 charter members of the Pi Chapter.

Strong Individuals Striving Together As Sisters (SISTAS) was established by co-founders Tina Park and Alice Vuong with the intention of laying the foundation for a chapter of the sorority on campus. Following their belief that the sorority would provide Asian American women with a support system not otherwise found on campus, the ladies of SISTAS worked persistently to become a group that would acquire the respect and interest from the Virginia Tech campus, surrounding community of Blacksburg, and the existing chapters of alpha Kappa Delta Phi.
          Joined by Kokoro Fujiyama, Marylynn Jansak, Nicole Shin, Erica Sok, Carol Tsai, Hannah Xiu, and Melody Yok; the 9 women worked together to lay the foundation of friendship and sisterhood. Through their dedicated efforts, the ladies of SISTAS impacted the community with their message of Asian Awareness, sisterhood and charity. In the Spring of 2002, the sisters of the Theta Chapter of alpha Kappa Delta Phi at the University of Pennsylvania, the first full-fledged chapter on the East Coast, was granted the privilege of hosting the pledging colony of Virginia Tech. After almost a year of work in addition to the continued support of their host chapter, UPenn, and pledge mom, Margaret Shea, the ladies at Virginia Tech were able to realize their own potential and abilities while reaching their long-held goals.
          On April 14, 2002, the ladies of SISTAS proudly became the 32nd chapter of the nation’s largest and most prestigious Asian American sorority, alpha Kappa Delta Phi. Now loving and devoted sisters of alpha Kappa Delta Phi, the Virginia Tech Colony Chapter continues to grow as individuals and as sisters, through love and everlasting friendship💜

Alpha Phi encourages and endlessly supports our members when trying new things or taking on new leadership roles. 
Each member of Alpha Phi is extremely special and plays a huge role in what makes our chapter unique. We are constantly pushing ourselves to be better and do better and to leave an impact for years to come. Union hand in hand.
